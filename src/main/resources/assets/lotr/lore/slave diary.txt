I still remember the day, for it is burned bright into my memory.

I was out upon the beach, not far from my village, collecting shells for my grandmother. Ever since my father perished in battle, I always did my best to make her smile now and again.

But then, out of nowhere, the ships appeared. Sails, black as night, flying banners of evil eyes and twisting serpents.

I ran to the village to warn them, but there was nothing I could do. For the Corsairs were quick and merciless. They burned our village and took what few valuable goods we had. We few who survived were enslaved, I among them. The fate of my grandmother I do not know.

Now, it has been three summers since that terrible day. I have been sold like a beast in the slave markets of Umbar, and now serve some Southron savage, along with countless others like me. I curse the Sun for every new day that she brings. But there are few things that yet give me hope.

Even in this pit of despair I have made a fast friend. {name:moredain_male} is his name, and he is wise, and with his wisdom he helps us to endure all of this. He hails from the uttermost South, and - I did not believe it at first - he was sold by his own tribe to the Corsairs! If not for his friendship, I would have abandoned all hope long ago.

And there is more: at last, a glimmer of hope for us poor creatures. It seems that many of the Southron warriors are preparing to march North. If they go, they will leave these lands barely defended. Then we may be able to escape, or rise up against our cruel masters! I scarecely dare to think it, for fear it will not come to pass...

I will continue to hide this diary from the masters of Umbar, for it gives me the strength to endure this suffering.
