If this book is found, I have doomed myself, for these words now written must never be read by another.

It has been three years now since our King took this Queen of Harad as his wife. Born to a Southern Númenórean noble, Berúthiel appears to be a great match for our King, who can use this bond to finally forge a peace with the Southrons. Yet, after years of investigation I have uncovered things better left uncovered.

Queen Berúthiel is a rare beauty indeed, but also ruthless and hungry for power and wealth. She was a women of many men, yet never belonging to any one of them. She seduced Haradrim Princes and chieftains alike, using her beauty to take their wealth and power for her own. She was showered with gold and silver by the Princes of the Two Sisters, while being courted by the mightiest of Umbar's warriors. Even the greatest chieftains of the Far Harad came north for hundred of leagues, all so that they might earn a single glance at her striking eyes. Gardens were built, statues were erected, yet she remained unimpressed.

Now, she has been taken to wife by the greatest King of them all, and I fear what she might do to him. She wields no sword, but a weapon no man can withstand, not even a King. My hands are bound, for speaking against my own Queen would surely amount to treason. There must be a way to save my King and Kingdom... there must be.
