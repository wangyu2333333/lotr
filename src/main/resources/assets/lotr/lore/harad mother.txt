This day, the twenty-first of the tenth month, year 1050 of the Third Age:

Dear Mother,

I know you cursed me for surrendering to the Gondorians. But please, hear what I have to say.

The King Ciryaher is a merciful ruler. He is not at all like we feared. He has granted me and all my brothers our lives if we swear loyalty to him and his realm. Even more, he offered us lands and riches as a reward for our loyalty. His Highness has bestowed upon me a beautiful strip of land just east of Umbar, with fertile fields, wide orchards, and a grand mansion to live in.

I know it is hard, Mother, but I beg you - do not let your pride bring ruin upon our family. Is it really your wish to die in exile, to make the burning sands your grave? And not only yours, but my brothers' and sisters' also? Do not let your hatred for Gondor decide how you must live out your days. Gondor may have conquered our homelands, but the Sun will continue to rise every day. The lemon trees will continue to grow.

Please, Mother, come back to me, and let my brothers and sisters grow old.

With love,
your son, {name:nearHaradrim_male}
