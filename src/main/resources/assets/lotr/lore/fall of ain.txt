Ain an-Ahâr:
This day, the twenty-fourth of the sixth month, year 1050 of the Third Age:

My dear brother, I write in haste with urgent news.

Ciryaher - curse his name! - has crushed our forces by the waters of the Athrassir. I retreated with what is left of my host to Ain an-Ahâr.

The situation is dire. The Prince refused to submit to the invaders, and has taken his own life. Half of my men deserted me after hearing the news! Only the desperate and doomed now remain, guarding our walls. The gods have forsaken us.

It will not be long until Ciryaher and his invaders take the city, I fear. Take your warriors east to meet with the allied tribes, and gather more strength.

I beseech you, do not yet engage the dogs of Gondor. Live to fight another day. My time on this earth has come to an end; I shall find honour in death.

Your brother Ashur, chief of the Serpent Guard
