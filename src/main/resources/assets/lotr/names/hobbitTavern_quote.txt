"In a hole#in the ground,#there lived#a Hobbit."
"The Road#goes ever#on#and on..."
"Roads go ever#ever on,#over rock and#under tree..."
"It is useless#to meet revenge#with revenge."
"The world#is indeed#full of peril."
"Not all those#who wander#are lost."
"Courage#is found#in unlikely#places."
"Go forward?#Only thing#to do!"
"Adventures?#Nasty things,#they are."
"Short cuts#make for#long delays."
"May the hair#on your toes#never#fall out!"
"Handsome is as#handsome does."
"I don't want#any adventures,#thank you#very much!"
"One should#go to bed late,#and get up#later."
"Warmth,#good food,#and comfort."
"A dangerous#business it is,#going out your#front door."
"It was a#Hobbit hole,#and that#means comfort."
"The finest#pleasure#is a meal#well done."
"Apples for#walking, and#a pipe for#sitting."
"The world#is not in#your books#and maps."
"Never#laugh at#live dragons!"
"Short cuts#make delays,#but inns make#longer ones."
"All that is#gold does not#glitter."
"The old#that is strong#does not#wither."
"But the only#brew for#the brave#and true..."
"All's well#as ends well."
"Roads go ever#ever on,#under cloud and#under star..."
"While there's#life,#there's hope."
"Third time#pays for all."
"Keep your#heart up!"
"Go back?#No good#at all!"
"Even dragons#have their#endings."
"A day in#the garden#is a day#well spent."
"What a mess#are we in now!"
"It's never#too late#for a second#breakfast!"
"He thought#much, but#said little."
"There is more#in you good#than you know."
