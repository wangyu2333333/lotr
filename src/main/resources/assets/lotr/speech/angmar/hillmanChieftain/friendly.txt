My men await your command, #. Bring death to the Dúnedain!
May you break the bones of your enemies, #!
My men raise axes to fight for you, #!
Anything for a strong warrior with silver coins.
The Hillmen have no fear! Lead my men to battle, #!
Let us bathe in the blood of our enemies, #!
Our allegiance lies with Angmar. Their enemies are ours.
I have burned many Dúnedain villages, #. I know you will do the same!
Kill the Númenórean fiends!
May you split many heads in battle, #!
My men for your coins.
I see many victories in your conquest, #!
If you wish to kill the Westman, I can sell you my fighting forces.
Lead the Men of Rhudaur to victory!
Go, break skulls and smash faces, #!
My warriors shall streak the blood of Númenóreans across the battlefield, #!
