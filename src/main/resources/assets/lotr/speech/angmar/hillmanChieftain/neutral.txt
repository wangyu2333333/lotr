You have no trust with us, #!
My men only fight alongside true warriors of Rhudaur.
What makes you think you can lead my warriors to battle, #?
You have slain too few of the Númenórean filth, #.
Your hands are not red with Westmen's blood, #. You are not fit to command us.
Prove your might in battle, and only then my men will follow you.
Spill more blood, #, and then you may be worthy of my men.
My men raise axes for true warriors. You are no true warrior.
The terror of battle does not well befit weaklings like yourself, #.
My strong men don't follow weak leaders.
You have not shed enough blood, #.
You are weak like the Númenórean filth! Go, kill more of them. Then my men may fight for you, #.
