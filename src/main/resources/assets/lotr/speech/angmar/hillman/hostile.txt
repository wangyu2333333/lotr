I'll smash your face in!
Die, Westerman filth!
You are not one of the Hillmen. Flee, scum!
I'll crush your skull with my fist, Dúnadan scum!
Run while you still can!
You are an enemy of Angmar. Death awaits you!
You will bleed quickly and die fast, #!
I'll break your legs, and then you won't be running any more!
Your screams won't be heard by your filthy kin here!
Death to you and your kin!
I'll skin you like a rabbit!
You belong with the meat, roasting on my fire!
What Ranger fiend are you?
You are no friend of ours, #!
Your doom belongs to the Morgul-lords now, #!
Scream for your life, weakling!
You will squeal like the rest of the Númenórean rats!
Curse you, friend of the Westermen!
I will flay you alive!
I have gutted tougher fish than you, #!
