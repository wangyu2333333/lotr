You seem like a warrior of my kind, #.
Angmar will soon rise again!
I have crushed many heads in battle. Have you, #?
What do you need?
Angmar will rule and the lands of Númenóreans shall burn!
Númenóreans are filthy animals. They will all perish before the power of Angmar!
Welcome to our lands, #, friend of Angmar.
Warriors of great might, such as yourself, are welcome in these lands.
Rangers are no match for the strength of the Hillmen of Rhudaur!
Are you a warrior of Rhudaur, #?
Can you fight like the warriors of Rhudaur, #?
The blood of the Westermen will be shed soon enough.
Will you fight with us Hillmen, #?
We are glad to see you are an enemy of the Dúnedain Rangers, #.
Death to the Dúnedain!
Death to the Númenórean filth!
I have tasted the blood of Westermen many a time, and I shall again!
If you are an enemy of the Rangers, you are a friend of ours.
Any enemy of the Westermen is welcome in our lands.
