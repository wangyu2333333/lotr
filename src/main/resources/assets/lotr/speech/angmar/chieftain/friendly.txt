What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Morgul-scum here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The forces of Angmar are ready for hire, maggot!
Orcs, Trolls, Wargs, and more stinking Trolls! Get them all here!
The armies of Angmar shall rise! What do you need?
Give me some silver coins and I'll give you some of my boys!
Coins or no deal, maggot!
You need some legs? I've got some for you! Pay the price and I'll give you some of my best boys.
A Man has not commanded the forces of Angmar in many ages. Will you be the one who shall lead us to victory?
