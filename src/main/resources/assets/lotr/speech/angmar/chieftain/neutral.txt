You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of Men can command the Morgul-scum of Angmar, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any warriors to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The filth of Angmar would never follow a weakling like you into battle!
What are you trying to do, maggot? Kill some Man-scum and I'll let you command my boys!
You think you can command the legions of Angmar? Ha! Don't make me laugh, maggot.
Coins mean nothing if you can't keep your boys under control!
Ha! You must be a fool to think that I will let you command the Orcs of Angmar!
Filthy maggot! No mere Man can lead the mighty Orcs of Angmar!
