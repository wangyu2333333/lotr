The Boss wants us to grab some of the townsfolk's trinkets. Wants 'em brought back for inspection. But I'm a wanted thief around here - no chance I can be seen going around picking people's pockets! I tell you what, #. You go and do the dirty work for me - go after $, and we'll make it even. What do you say?
