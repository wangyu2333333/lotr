You're a busy one, aren't you? Run back to town!
Ha! You've got far too much on your plate to help me out.
The Boss has no use for a layabout like you! Get back to your job!
You aren't known for finishing a task, are you, #?
Ha! If I ask you for grog, it won't get here till Yuletide!
Ha! If I ask you for grog, it won't get here till Mid-year's Day!
No, #. Not you. Someone who I can trust.
I've got other boys who I can get to help me.
I'll do it myself rather than ask you for help!
Another useless townsfellow, that's all you are!
