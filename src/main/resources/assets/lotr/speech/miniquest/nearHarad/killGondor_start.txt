Greetings, #. Our Princes say that the last great war is near. We shall bring Gondor to its knees, avenging our fallen brethren who have given their lives over the centuries! Join our cause, and slay $. May you strike fear and terror into our foes' hearts! And you shall be rewarded greatly for this.
