Thieving, dirty scum... oh, it is you, #. Please forgive my cursing, but I have just yesterday been swindled out of all my livestock by those accursed nomads and their 'guards'! Now my family shall go hungry, unless I find a very generous butcher! Or perhaps you have $ yourself? I promise to pay you as fairly as I can!
