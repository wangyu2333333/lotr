I have fought in small campaigns against Gondor many times in past years, #. One thing I learned is that these so-called Rangers are the biggest threat to our plans. They are green demons, hiding amongst the trees with their witchcraft and stealth! We must thin their numbers before we start marching. Go and slay $!
