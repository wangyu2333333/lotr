Ah, Gondor. The Men of that realm are weak, and full of folly. Yet they hold themselves to be the heirs of Anadûnê! It is not so, #. It is we Umbarim who remember the coming of Ar-Pharazôn; it is we who remember the great lords Khôrumor and Phôinûr. And if you defeat $ in battle, then the fools of the North will know this too. Go, in the name of Umbar!
