When the last great war with Gondor comes, our friends in Ninzâyan and Azra-zâin will need something better than the arms and armour they make from bronze. I intend to travel there and teach them the smithcraft of Umbar, but I will need all I can carry for the journeys east and north. Perhaps, #, you have $ to trade?
