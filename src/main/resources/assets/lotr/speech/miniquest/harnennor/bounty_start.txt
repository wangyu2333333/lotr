Curse the Gondorians! They have sent one of their own into our lands, to come among us and slaughter our people! You must track down this so-called $ and put them to the sword. Many of our Southron brothers have been slain already!
The Men of Gondor are vile, treacherous cowards. And now one of them walks among us, striking from the shadows, murdering our people! Will you stand against this villain, oh great #?
My friend, they say you are a mighty warrior of Ninz√¢yan. Now there is a mercenary out of Gondor, by the name of $, they say. This wicked coward has already slain many of my people. Surely you will put a stop to these crimes?
