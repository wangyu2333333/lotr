You say you are a great warrior, #? Then prove it. The greatest of our warriors do battle not with scorpions and blundering warriors, but with the green Rangers of the Aphûr-lâi. Cowards and fiends they are, with evil witchcraft! If you dare, go north and defeat $. For honour and the glory of Khopazûl!
