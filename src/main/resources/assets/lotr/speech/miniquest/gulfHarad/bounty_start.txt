There walks a demon among us, a demon in the form of a Man! Men speak of one named $ who has come among our people to murder and destroy. My good #, you will rise to our aid, will you not? Yes! Then may the wrath of Mulkhêr the Mighty strengthen your hand as you move to strike down our foe!
My friend, # - you are our friend, are you not? And you are a mighty warrior, they say... I have heard dark rumours of an enemy named $ who has been murdering many of our good people. Surely you will hunt down this accursed one, and slay them where they stand. Yes! Then great shall be your reward!
I say to you, #, are you a friend of the people of the Gulf? Have you not heard the news of the great enemy $, and our people who lie dead by this enemy's hand? Then go out, and call upon the aid of Mulkhêr the Mighty, and slay our enemy with wrath and fire!
