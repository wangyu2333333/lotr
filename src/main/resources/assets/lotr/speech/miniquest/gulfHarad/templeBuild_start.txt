The temple to MulkhÃªr is in a sorry state. The walls are crumbling, and the roof is falling in... in recent years, we have had far too few sacrifices. Perhaps that is why. Nonetheless, we must repair the temple, else our crops will fail and our sons will not return from war! You must bring me $, my friend. Bring them at once!
