There is something wrong with the shipments of Mûmakil from the south. If I did not know better, I would almost believe there were never any Mûmakil here in the first place! But no. I suspect the work of those forest-savages, frustrating our beast-chainers. #! Go, cut down $, and send them fleeing back into the deepwoods!
