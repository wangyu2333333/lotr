You're looking for $, aren't you? I heard they were last seen by @.
I've got lots of contacts, #, and the word is your old friend $ was lurking around near @.
The boys near @ tell me they've seen $ sneaking around.
I've heard rumours of $ from the men over at @.
Aren't you going after $? Yes, you are. Well, might be you want to wander over to @.
