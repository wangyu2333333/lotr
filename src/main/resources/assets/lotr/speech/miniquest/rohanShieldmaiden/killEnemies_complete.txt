Hail, #! Truly, you are one of the Rohirrim. You have earned my respect this day - and my service.
So you have returned. I say I am surprised, # - but glad. Will you fight alongside me in battle?
Hail, #! These are glad tidings, for I have found one worthy of my sword. I will fight with you!
From this day, no woman nor man of Rohan could ever question your valiance, #. You have my sword!
Are the foes of Rohan slain? Are our people avenged? Then I will follow you into battle, #, as bravely as would any man.
Gladly will I follow you into battle, #. You have brought doom to our foes, and I hope we shall bring doom to many more.
