I see you have returned, #, yet you have not done all that you promised.
You must still slay $ before I will fight by your side.
Will you fight with me, #? Or have you lost heart? Go back and slay $!
#? I did not expect to see you so soon. And certainly not before you have slain $.
Well, well, look who it is! I thought you said you were going to kill $?
The enemies of Rohan still prowl these lands. Go, #, and slay $.
Do not forget what you promised me, #.
I am glad to see you return, #, but you have not yet slain $.
Are you going to kill the $, or must I do so myself?
