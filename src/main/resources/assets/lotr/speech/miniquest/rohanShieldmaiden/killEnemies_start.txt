Too much blood has been spilled by the foes of Rohan. I am seeking vengeance for our fallen, #. Can you say the same? If you can kill $ and return to tell the tale, then I will fight with you in battle.
I am a shieldmaiden of Rohan, #. The women-folk of Rohan are no less valiant than our men! And if you would earn my service, you'll need to prove your own valiance first. Go and slay $, and then I will fight by your side.
Any woman of Rohan can fight just as well as a man, though few of us choose that path. Will you fight with me, #? I ask only that you prove your strength - by slaying $. Our lands will be well rid of them.
I seek to fight alongside one who would avenge us on the foes of Rohan. Are you a friend of the Rohirrim, #? Ride out and stain your sword with the blood of $. If you chance to return, you will have gained the service of a true warrior.
