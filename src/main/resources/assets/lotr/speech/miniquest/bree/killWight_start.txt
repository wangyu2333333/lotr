You may have heard of the Barrow-downs near our borders? Well, I fear that the creatures in those cursed lands are plotting to attack us. Instead, we should strike at them before they can make their move. Would you be so brave as to journey in and fight off $? I will personally see to it that the town Sherriff rewards you for this feat!
