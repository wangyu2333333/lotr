Ah, #! You might be the saviour I need in this dire time! You see, I help the Southlinch farmers out with managing their pipe-weed and I was supposed to bring a batch of it to the market. However, I thought one puff couldn't hurt, right, and... well, to keep it short, I smoked it all by accident. Could you get me $ and save me please? I promise I will not touch it!
