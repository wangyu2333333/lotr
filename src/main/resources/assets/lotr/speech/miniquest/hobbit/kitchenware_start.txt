We Hobbits treasure our kitchenware above all else. But after last night's party, I noticed that a few of my prized possessions were missing. It must have been those accursed Sackville-Bagginses! Dear, dear... I don't suppose you'd be willing to help out an old Hobbit? Find me $ and I'll be very grateful.
