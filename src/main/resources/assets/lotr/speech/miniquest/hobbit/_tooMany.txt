You've got unfinished business with other folk around here, #!
I heard you'd offered to help out some other fellows. Well, I can't be asking you for more now, can I?
You're a busy fellow, #. I can't be giving you more to do.
Aren't you already busy enough, #?
It wouldn't be right of me to ask for help, with all that unfinished business of yours.
Oh, I couldn't possibly burden you any further, #. I've heard you have your hands full from other requests.
My goodness, you are such an eager helper, #! Come back later when you have more time on your hands?
I'm afraid you simply have too much to do to bother with my problems.
Maybe you should help who you promised to help first, before you come making promises to me as well, #.
I think you have enough to do for now, #.
No no, I can wait. You can help the others first.
