You should make good on your other promises first, #.
You have already pledged to help others, #. Honour your promises!
Go and make good on your promises before you speak to me.
We Men of Umbar remember our promises to others, #, and you should too.
You are too busy to take on what I would ask of you.
You are busy, #. I can ask no more of you.
I could not offer my service to one with so many unkept promises.
