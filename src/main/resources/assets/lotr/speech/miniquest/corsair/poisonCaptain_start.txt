Quiet, #! Keep this between you and me. Our captain's been a right old rat lately, and I'm starting to think he's lost his sea legs. He doesn't know what to do with the crew half the time. I'm thinking there's someone who'd make a much better cap'n, if you get my meaning. If someone with $ turned up, I'd have no choice but to pay them very well for it.
