The Northern scum have sent one of their dogs to come and kill our men. We can't have that, can we? This $ must be found, and slain. And there'll be booty for the one who does it!
There's talk of an enemy about. The boys at port have told me about men dropping dead all over the land, and they say a so-called $ is to blame! We can't have that, can we, #? So here's what we'll do. You'll find $, kill the scum, and I'll pay you for your trouble.
There's one of those rats from the North been burning our supplies! Name of $, they say. Our captain'll pay well to anyone who gives the scum a good seeing-to! I would go and kill them myself, but I'm very busy right now. Lots of work to do at port, you see.
