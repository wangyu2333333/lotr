In the far South live a strange people who we call the Orunlâi. They're cowards, afraid of the outside world, with little strength in arms. For this, they make great slaves! If you sail through those lands, be sure to kill $ and beat some good, healthy fear into the hearts of the Orunlâi. Then our raiding will be all the easier.
