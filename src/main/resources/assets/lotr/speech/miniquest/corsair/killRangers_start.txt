Cursed and blighted be those Rangers! One of them sneaked onto our last voyage while we were at BÃªlkadar port, and did away with all our crew while they were asleep! Set all the slaves free, too! Luckily, I was on watch duty, so I kept quiet and escaped... but now, those Rangers need paying back. I want $ dead, and I'm offering a hefty sum.
