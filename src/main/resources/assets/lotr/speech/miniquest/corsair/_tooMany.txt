You're a busy land-rat, aren't ye?
Har! Ye've got far too many jobs to help me out!
I'll ask someone else, ye useless land-rat.
Go on, #! Crawl back to the lords of the land, and do what they told you.
You aren't known for finishing a task.
It looks like yer promise is about as valuable as an empty chest!
No, #. Not you. Someone who I can trust.
I've got other boys who I can ask to help me.
I'll do it myself rather than ask you for help!
Another useless land-rat, that's what you are!
