Hail, friend #! I am told you have brought justice to those renegades! You have earned much favour in the eyes of the White Tower.
A grim task indeed, #, but we are grateful for your service to Gondor and our people. Here is the reward I promised.
No longer shall those traitors spill our secrets to the accursed Southrons. You have earned much favour with Gondor today.
