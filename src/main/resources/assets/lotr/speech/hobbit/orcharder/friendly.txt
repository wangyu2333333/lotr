Good day, #.
Good day!
Welcome to my orchard, #!
And how are you on this fine day, #?
I have enough fruit to feed half the Shire!
Do you want to buy any fruits of the orchard, #?
If you cut down any trees, please replant them!
These fruits are so tasty!
Got any silver coins? I have some fine produce for sale.
I hope you're not trespassing!
Don't cut down too many trees!
I offer you the finest fruit in all the Shire!
What can I get you, #?
If you've got some silver coins, then we can trade!
My orchard always has fresh fruit for my customers!
