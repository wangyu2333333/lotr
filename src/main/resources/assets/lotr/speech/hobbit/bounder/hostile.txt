And what do you think you're up to, #?
Troublemaker! We don't tolerate you in these parts!
Get out of the Shire, #!
Get out of the Shire!
I'll be reporting you to my old Gaffer!
Stay away from the Shire!
You're pushing your luck, coming into these parts.
So you're one of these troublemakers I've been hearing about. Stay away, #!
Uncouth folk like you aren't welcome here, #!
Just what do you think you're doing coming into the Shire, #?
By the feather in my hat, I'll put a stop to your mischief!
I will not allow you to cause mischief here, #! Leave the Shire!
I knew you were up to no good! 
We do not appreciate troublemakers such as you in the Shire!
Stop causing trouble or you'll have trouble with me, #!
Don't think you can get away with your mischief, #!
