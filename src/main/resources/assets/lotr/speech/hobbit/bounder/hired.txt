Good day, #.
Let's go and root out some troublemakers.
For the Shire!
Is it time for second breakfast yet?
May the hair on your toes never fall out, Chief!
What would you have me do, Chief?
On duty, Chief!
There must be some troublemakers round here.
If you see any mischief, I'll put a stop to it!
Time to put a stop to some mischief!
Let's drive the troublemakers out of our lands!
I can't wait to face my first troublemaker!
I will do as you ask, Chief!
I protect the Shire from mischief!
What do you need, Chief?
