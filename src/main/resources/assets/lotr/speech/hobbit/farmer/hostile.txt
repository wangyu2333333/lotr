Strange folk have been seen in these parts, and you look like one of them.
I hear you've been causing trouble round here.
You look like a troublemaker!
You look like a troublemaker, #.
Aren't you one of those strange folk I've heard talk of?
Stay away from the Shire, #.
Stay out of the Shire!
I shan't be lending you any of my pipe-weed!
We don't take kindly to folk like you.
You're not a nice fellow, #.
There's talk of strange folk round here. Might you be one of them?
If you'll be begging my pardon, you make me feel uncomfortable.
You're one for the Mewlips, #!
I knew you queer old Big Folk were trouble!
We don't appreciate folk like you in the Shire.
The Shire is no place for troublemakers like you!
You'd better leave the Shire, #, or I'll call the Bounders!
I've seen strange folk lurking around these parts, and you remind me of one of them. I don't trust you.
