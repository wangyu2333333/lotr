The road goes ever on and on...
Get off my ale!
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh!
Roll roll roll roll, roll-roll-rolling down the hole!
Heave ho! Splash plump! Down they go, down they bump!
But the only brew for the brave and true...
Hey ho! To the bottle I go!
I drink, therefore I am.
Tippity tippity tap! Splish splash splosh!
Fear! Fire! Foes!
My ale! Mine!
Do not turn me about so, #. My stomach is not constant.
Stop walking on the wall, #! Ho! Ho!
Here and there, ale is everywhere!
I couldn't live without my ale!
The ale is mine! 
Up and down and left and right, I will drink until the end of night!
Teh to ti ti tum!
Trolls have layers!
More ale in my pail!
These Orcs are crazy!
Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom!
Never fear quarrels, but seek hazardous adventure!
He can be found in marsh, over hill, under tree, and where the water licks the land!
I used to be an adventurer, just like you. Then I discovered ale!
*hic*
Help! Everything is square! How long have I been here? Am I going mad? Please help me, #!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of your finest ale!
They see me! They see you! They see everything!
Spring is coming, at least I think it is! What am I saying? More ale all round!
A fine pail of ale is finer than a fresh quail of nail!
Where is my Hobbit-hole?
A song! A song!
Sing, #! Sing!
My singing talent eclipses even that of the Elves!
Give me a reason to fight and I shall drink ale!
Hill. Tree. Lake. Another hill. Yellow!
Praise be to the Great Lion!
Not all those who wander are lost, #!
You're a little small for an Oliphaunt!
Well, well, haven't you come a long way! I haven't seen you in years, #!
