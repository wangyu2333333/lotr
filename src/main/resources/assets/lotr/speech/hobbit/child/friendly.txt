Is it time for second breakfast yet?
Are you Gandalf?
Would you like to stay for dinner?
Mother says I can have a pipe when I'm older!
I want to see Elves! Have you ever met Elves?
Hello, #!
You're not a Hobbit, are you?
Where do you live, #?
Will you teach me to blow smoke rings?
Are you one of the Big Folk, #?
Do you have some tales you could tell me?
Good day, #!
I can't wait to be older! I want to go on adventures! Just like that old uncle Bilbo...
I hear there are Elves in the woods! Have you seen them?
