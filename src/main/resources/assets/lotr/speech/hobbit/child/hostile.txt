I don't like you. Go away.
Mother told me not to talk to strange people like you.
Go away, #!
You're a nasty person.
You're scary.
You're one of those weird Big Folk. Leave me alone!
You better run or I'll call my father to get you!
The Shirriffs will take care of you!
I won't talk with weird strangers!
I don't like scary strangers!
