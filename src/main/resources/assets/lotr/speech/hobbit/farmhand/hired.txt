Hello there, mister #!
Am I doing my job well, mister #?
Po-ta-toes! Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew...
I ain't been dropping no eaves, mister #, I swear!
We Hobbits of the Shire are the best farmers in all Middle-earth!
And how are you today, mister #?
I can't wait to get back to work!
A day spent on the fields is a good day indeed, mister #.
It's almost harvest time!
I wasn't lollygagging. I'm doing my job, sir!
I'm doing my duty!
I can't wait for spring to come!
Harvest time is coming soon!
What can I do for you, #?
