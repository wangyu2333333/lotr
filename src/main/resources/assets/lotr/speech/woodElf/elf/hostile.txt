Flee this forest, you Morgul-demon!
Return to the corruption whence you came!
You are not welcome here, #!
You are no friend of the Elvenking!
Let's see you fight with an arrow in your flesh!
You should not have come here, #!
May you be consumed by the spiders of the Enemy!
Do not bring evil into our land, #!
Ha! You are no match for our bows and arrows!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of Evil.
You shall face the same doom as your master, wretch of Dol Guldur!
I will not allow you to corrupt this forest!
You shall soon meet your end by our mighty bows.
Do not think I won't kill you, Orc-filth!
