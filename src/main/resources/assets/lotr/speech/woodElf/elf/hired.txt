We fight for the Woodland Realm!
You may be skilled in fighting, #, but even you cannot match our abilities.
Silver coins mean little to an Elf. We have chosen to fight with you because it suits us, #.
Our foes shall fall and be trampled like the leaves of the forest!
Neither spider, Orc filth, nor wicked Man may stand against the power of Mirkwood!
For Mirkwood!
For the Woodland Realm! For the Elvenking!
My arrows shall be swift and my blade sharp as they seek the flesh of the enemy.
All foul things shall perish before the bows and blades of Mirkwood.
May the grace of the Valar protect us in combat, #.
My bow shall sing with your sword, #!
The bones of our foes will gleam under the Sun, #.
Let us cleanse this world of the foul scum of Mordor!
The days grow dark and cold, but the light of the Elves is not yet gone from this realm!
Evil is beginning to gather again in the fortress of Dol Guldur. It cannot be allowed to threaten our lands.
I shall follow you through shadow and flame! None shall withstand the gleaming light of our swords!
In the name of all that is good and true, let us cleanse this world of evil!
We must not allow evil to spread!
Let us cleanse this forest of the evil that poisons it!
The foul spawn of Ungoliant shall tremble before us!
No spawn of evil shall enter the Woodland Realm under our watch!
