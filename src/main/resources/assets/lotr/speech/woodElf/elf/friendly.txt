Welcome to the land of the Elvenking, #.
Welcome to our woodland realm.
Let us drink wine and be merry together!
What tidings from the world of Men, #?
Greenwood of old this forest was called... but now a shadow lies over it.
Beware the spawn of Ungoliant!
Take care in the woods, #. You might lose your way...
Do not wander too deeply into the forest, #, for evil things lurk within.
What business brings you to these lands, #?
We Elves of the Woodland Realm must remain vigilant, for there is always evil on our borders.
Always we must be on the watch, #.
The land beyond our borders is rife with corruption. But it was not always so...
Beware the waters of these lands! A powerful enchantment flows within them.
Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me!
Ah, the wine of Dorwinion... the sweetest liquor that did ever pass my lips.
The bows of Mirkwood are swifter than all others.
We are the Silvan Elves of the Woodland Realm.
May the stars of Elbereth guide you!
May the winds of Manwë show you the way!
Ae Aerendil, angalef in-elin!
A star shines upon the hour of our meeting, #.
May the wind fill your sails!
May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown, #!
Ai, #!
Don't look for trouble, # - it will come to you.
Welcome to my dwelling, #.
Nover.
The world is changed. I feel it in the water... I feel it in the earth... I smell it in the air.
The time of our kin is almost done. 
Our hearts desire to behold the land of Aman.
Soon we shall leave this world.
White gulls are calling...
The Nameless One has returned. We cannot stay in these lands for long.
That which has stood so long against the darkness will now fall.
We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.
That what should be shall be.
Our love for this land is deeper than the depths of the Sea.
We would rather cast all that we love away than submit to the will of the Dark Lord.
The world is changed; I can feel it in the water, I can feel it in the earth, I can smell it in the air.
Rumour grows of a shadow in the East. We fear that the Nameless One has returned.
The Sea calls us home.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Some things that should have not been forgotten were lost.
Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling.
A star rises out of the darkness.
Hail, Eärendil, brightest of stars!
Be on your guard, #. I fear that an evil presence has taken shelter in this forest. I can sense it.
Welcome to our fair realm, #.
Welcome to the land of Lord Thranduil, king of the Woodland Realm!
Do not wander carelessly through the forest, #. There are evil things that linger within.
Thanks to the guidance of our King and our skill, we were able to endure in this realm, though barely.
The trees of these woods have long protected us from the dangers of the outside world.
You have not truly drunk wine until you have tasted the fine grapes of Dorwinion!
Something dark and evil has once more taken hold of the black hill of Dol Guldur.
May you have peace under the fair green crowns of the trees in this realm, #!
In these dark times many dangers surround our borders. Be on your guard, #.
