Take your evil and flee these lands, #!
We do not welcome your kind here.
You should not have come here!
You are no match for the warriors of the Elvenking!
One way or another, you shall depart our lands!
You are mistaken if you think you can threaten us!
Flee, Morgul-scum!
Back into the shadows, you villain!
You were wrong to set foot here, #!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone from our lands, scum of Dol Guldur.
You shall soon meet your end, servant of evil.
Go back to the darkness whence you came!
