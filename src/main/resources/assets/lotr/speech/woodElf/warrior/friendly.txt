I defend this woodland realm from those who would seek its destruction.
There is powerful magic here.
Beware, #... there is much evil afoot in these lands.
I fight for the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood.
It is not often that Men venture into Mirkwood from outside.
Stay out of the shadows, #.
Much evil lurks beyond our borders.
A star shines upon the hour of our meeting, Elf-friend.
Welcome to the land of the Elvenking, #.
Welcome to our woodland realm.
Beware the spawn of Ungoliant!
We Elves of the Woodland Realm must remain vigilant, for there is always evil on our borders.
Always we must be on the watch, #.
Greetings, #. Welcome to the realm of the Elvenking.
Welcome to our fair realm, #. What tidings do you bring to us from the world of Men?
Be on your guard, #. The woods that lie beyond our borders are filled with creatures of shadow.
The woods around these lands are becoming more and more perilous.
I fear that the Shadow has once more returned to that accursed fortress in the south of Mirkwood.
