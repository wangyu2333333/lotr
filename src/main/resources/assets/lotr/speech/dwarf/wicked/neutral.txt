Do we serve the same master, #?
All the way from the East, to end up here? What an ill fate.
You mistake me for a scavenger! I will not trade with one like you.
Ha! I do not sell my craft to any old rogue!
Where do your loyalties lie, #?
Are you a Longbeard spy, perhaps?
They have sent men after me before. Why should I trust you?
Even I would not stoop so low as to trade with you!
By my beard! You think you are worthy of Dwarvish smithcraft?
I will not trade with you, #. The Bosses would not allow it!
Why, you might be a spy out of Baraz-t√ªm! No trade.
