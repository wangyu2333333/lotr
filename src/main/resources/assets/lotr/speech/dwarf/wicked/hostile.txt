Don't expect to get the better of me, you rowdy lad!
I'll cleave your miserable skull in twain!
Come on, lad! Show me what you've got!
Suffer the wrath of the Dwarves, #!
Came you here only to be crushed?
Draw your last breath, #!
Raaarrrgh!
I'll crush you like a rock, lad!
What were you thinking, picking a fight with me? Ha!
Khazâd ai-mênu!
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
Begone, tark filth!
Did they send you here to get me? Ha! Come on then!
Come on then, #!
I'll toss your head back to the Red Mountains!
You're no match for a rogue like me!
Du Bekar! Du Bekar!
Aye lad, you're fighting for the wrong side!
Aye, let's get on with it then!
Exile has made me mighty!
I'm a Dwarf! Not some weakling Rukhs!
Crawl back to your Longbeard paymasters!
Aye, did the Stiffbeards send you after me?
