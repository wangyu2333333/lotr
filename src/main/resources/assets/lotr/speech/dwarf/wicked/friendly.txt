A fellow rogue!
A fellow rogue! Greetings, #!
By my beard, someone who's not an Orc! Bless ye, lad!
Curse these Rakhâs! They stink like the pits of Khazad-dûm!
Many years I have been wandering, #.
They exiled me for my deeds, so I went and joined the Goblins. Nasty creatures.
I may be an outcast, my friend, but aren't we all here?
I may be an outcast, but by my beard, I still know how to work good steel!
All the way from the East, to end up here? What an ill fate.
Wicked, they call me. If you'd been brought up over there, you'd have run away too, #.
Aye, they call them Stiffbeards for good reason!
You need to work on that beard, #.
What tidings do you bring? What news of the Seven Houses?
My beard is the envy of all Dwarves!
Do they still speak of me in Baraz-tûm?
Those Easterling ladies love my beard, aye! Ha! Ha!
I still dream of roaring fires, fresh ale, and ripe meat off the bone...
My smithcraft is finer than any of those cowards beneath the Mountain!
