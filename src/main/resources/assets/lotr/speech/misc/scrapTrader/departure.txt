Come now, #. Or you shall forever hold your scrap!
#, are you sure you have no scrap to spare? For I shall have to leave soon! I accept firstborns for coin too...
It is almost time for me to leave, #. So hurry if you want me to take your oddments off your hands!
I'm sure we can strike one last deal, #.
Can you spare just a little more scrap before I depart these forsaken lands?
It's the scrap that's never collected that takes longest to sell, #. So before I leave, can you not spare a little more scrap for a poor old oddment collector?
I shall soon be taking a well-earned break. So, quickly, #, bring me your last scrap!
I fear this place has little else to offer me in the scrap market. I shall soon depart to richer lands.
The scrap that one hoards is worth little more than pebbles, #. So come now and sell that rubbish of yours before I go far away!
The road must go on, #! Who am I but a humble scrap collector to stop it. So before I hasten over the hills, let me rid you of any unwanted odds and ends.
Come trade with me quickly, #! For I shall soon be leaving these lands to seek the wealth of the Gundabad Orcs.
I'm feeling thirsty, #. A stay at a good inn would do me well! Luckily I know one near the mountains blue, so come quick or you shall miss me.
My deals don't last forever, #.
A rest in a comfortable bed beckons, #. Oddment collectors have to sleep too!
Roll up, roll up! Last scrap deals for many weeks!
Do you have no more scrap, #? Then I shall have to leave.
We scrap collectors move often to find the best sources of oddments. I am no exception, #.
Business is slow here. Perhaps it is time to seek my fortunes elsewhere.
