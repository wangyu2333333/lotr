How did I wander down here so far, you ask? I have my ways!
Well, fancy seeing you down here!
Let's see... now, where did I leave my heathers...
You followed me all the way in here just to sell me your scrap? I'm flattered, #.
Where there's beings who'll trade, there's money to be made!
I'm here to hunt Balrogs. Yes, that sounds believable.
It's almost harvesting season.
Flesh! Flesh! Flesh... goes for a surprisingly good price down here!
Well, this wasn't supposed to happen.
#! Of all the people I expected to see down here...
#? Who let you in?
If I'm down here with you, then who's trading with the people up above?
There has been a mistake.
I'll see you down on the fourth level.
I'm looking for the fourth level, #. Have you found it yet?
I'm planning to steal the Star of Eärendil. Don't tell anyone!
Goodness me. #! This is an unlikely surprise.
Flesh of the tormented, blood of the forsaken, screams of the - oddments! Yes, oddments... do you have any to sell?
Fancy that! #! And now I shall have to be on my way.
What? What am I doing down in the pits of Utumno? Well, what are you doing down in the pits of Utumno, #?
Now if I could only find a way down into the fourth pits...
A key of ice is rather nice, but a key of fire I truly... goodness me, it's you, #!
I seek the keys of fire. And I shouldn't have told you that, should I? Not to worry, you'll never make it out of here alive...
Mbelekóro? But I thought you were - oh, it's just you, #. Do excuse me.
Ah, I remember this place back when they still called it Utumna.
