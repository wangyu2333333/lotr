I shall never have dealings with you again!
May your metal rust, #!
Begone, fool!
My trade has brought me into many dangers. I am well-accustomed to thugs like you!
You are bad for business!
I don't plan to end my scrap trading days here!
A rusty blade would be a kindness for you!
I will never accept your scrap!
I curse you to a life of little coin!
I will not negotiate with bandits!
In all my years I have never seen one so awful as you, #!
I may be a humble tradesman, but a coward I am not!
You will not see another moon, #!
You are a fool, #!
It shames me to think I would have traded with you, #!
Do not approach me again, #!
May your weapon forever rust!
Your gold is fake, #!
Begone, #!
I hope never to set eyes upon you again, #!
You will rot, #!
Tradesmen will spit upon your name and your grave!
Why do you challenge me, #?
Curse you, #!
Curse you to poverty!
I curse your name and your goods, #!
You are nothing but a common scoundrel! Begone, #!
Do not suppose to trade with me!
Begone, you ruffian!
Get away from me, ruffian!
You look like a common bandit! Off with you!
