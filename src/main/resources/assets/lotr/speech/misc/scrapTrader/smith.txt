A deal well done, my friend. Now off you go!
As you see, #, my skills in smithcraft are unmatched!
'Twas a pleasure to relieve you of your coin.
What, do you regret our little deal? Time is too short for regret, my friend. Go and enjoy yourself!
That may have been the best trade deal in the history of trade deals.
What? You didn't want all those coins weighing you down, did you?
I hope you're satisfied with that. I certainly am!
I bet you've never seen a better piece of smithcraft in all your life.
And that's what you get for asking a wandering scrap trader to smith your precious trinkets!
Customer satisfaction has never been higher.
Do you know that sound, #? It's the sound of a deal well struck!
You can't complain. I'm cheaper than most.
I'm almost as great a wordsmith as I am a worker of metals.
Even the Lambengolmor of Tirion upon TÃºna are no match for my skill with words.
We scrap traders are masters of words and names.
That was the best trade deal I've seen since the days of the Lamps.
What, is there something wrong?
I learned my letters from the kind of teachers you could only dream of having.
What? The smithing process often goes wrong, #. We can't all be Telchars and Celebrimbors.
Smithcraft is a fine art, #. You shouldn't complain about little mistakes here and there.
Good, good! Now take it, and be on your way.
I am but a humble wandering merchant. Forgive me if I made a small mistake.
Another deal well struck! Now don't you have business elsewhere, #?
'Twas a pleasure, #! Now I suppose you'll be on your way.
