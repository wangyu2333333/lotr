We are tasked to guard these lands, #, and guard them we shall.
Myself and my company keep Ithilien safe.
What brings you to this pleasant land, #?
The land of Ithilien is fair and green, but there are those who would wish to claim it for themselves.
The shadow of the East lies always on our hearts, #.
Good day, #. From which land do you hail?
Keep a safe camp at night, and stay out of the shadows.
It is not for nothing that we watch these lands, #. The threat of the enemy is ever on our borders.
We have ways to walk unseen beneath the trees and the moon.
These are the lands of the Men of Gondor, and we Rangers safeguard them.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the Orc that one fears.
In Elder Days, we Men of NÃºmenor learned much from the Elves. Now that knowledge is all but forgotten among the race of Men.
Our duty is to guard these lands from the evil that comes from Mordor.
This land is truly fair. But even such a fair realm as this is in danger of the menacing claw of evil.
His black hand is ever upon us.
Do not travel on the roads, #. They can be very dangerous in these dark times.
Fair Ithilien has long been a province of Gondor. But now it is under the threat of the Dark Lord.
Our enemies are gathering beyond the Harnen.
Curse the Southrons!
Beware the Southrons of Harnennor. They are cruel, and fierce in battle.
The Enemy has the Men of Harad under his sway.
Foes to the South, foes to the East... but we must remain hopeful, #.
If not for us, #, then Gondor would have been overrun long ago.
The Men of Harad are well nigh all under the sway of the Enemy.
