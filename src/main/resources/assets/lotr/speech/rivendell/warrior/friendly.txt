The time of the Elves is fading, but our strength is not yet gone.
I defend the Elves of Imladris.
Greetings, #.
We defend the free peoples of Middle-earth.
It seems you are a friend of the Elves, #.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
How many Orcs have you slain today, #?
The world is changing, #... I feel it in my heart.
If you fight for freedom, then I am with you.
Long ago, an alliance existed between my people and yours. Will you honour that alliance?
Ever stronger grows the sway of the Enemy over our lands.
Welcome, #, to the land of Elrond Half-elven!
You shall find no evil in Rivendell, #! Our land is safe and fair.
I have protected this valley for many a year.
I protect the High Elves of Imladris. No evil shall escape my wrath.
The power of the Elves is waning in this world, but our strength is not yet gone!
