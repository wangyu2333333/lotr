Greetings from the land of Imladris, #!
The treasures of Rivendell may be bought for silver coins.
If you desire Elven crafts, I could exchange something for silver coins.
Do you wish to trade, #?
The sea calls me home, but I value silver coins as much as the next merchant.
Greetings, #. Perhaps you have something to trade?
I am a High Elf of the folk of Lord Elrond.
I shall soon be leaving these shores.
I bring you the craftwork of the Elves of Rivendell!
Mae govannen, #! Do you wish to trade with me?
I have travelled far and wide... and now I come to you! I have many treasures that will interest you, #.
I hail from Imladris, and I bring many gifts and treasures with me!
You have not seen beauty until you have beheld the valley of Imladris, #!
