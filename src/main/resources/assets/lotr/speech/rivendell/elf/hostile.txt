No evil may set foot in Imladris!
You may not enter Rivendell.
#, you may not set foot in Rivendell!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no Elf-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Imladris!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison the Last Homely House!
To Ud√ªn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of evil!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
