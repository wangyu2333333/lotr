Welcome to the land of Bree!
Welcome to @!
Welcome to @, #!
We've been getting more Southerners coming up the Greenway lately.
You're not one of them Rangers, are you?
It's been raining a lot lately, have you noticed?
If you are here for our excellent pipe-weed, we grow them on the southern slopes.
Not a lot of people know this, but we in Bree were the first to discover pipe-weed.
We aren't getting a lot of travellers from the West anymore.
If you plan on heading further East, make sure to stop by the Forsaken Inn - it's the last civilised place that way.
I'm originally from Archet, a smaller village by the Chetwood.
Combe is all right, but I prefer Bree-hill myself.
I love listening to tales and songs from our guests.
Every time the Dwarves come by, our coffers are filled with gold and our casks are empty of ale.
News came that something is stirring in the East. I hope it doesn't reach Bree.
It has been raining an awful lot here lately...
There's an old saying here in Bree: when the rain comes, strange folk follow.
Rain, rain, rain. Nothing but rain here in Bree. What I would not do for some snow, instead.
They say when it rains the best tales are told over a flagon of ale.
Welcome, welcome! Oh... what was your name again?
We have rooms for Dwarves, Hobbits, even Elves!
Join us in the common room, tell a tale or two! We love to hear what's going on outside of Bree!
We have a fine company tonight, I do hope you will join us in our merrymaking?
I would never leave Bree. Not even to visit the Shire.
Have you heard any news from the Shire?
Any news from the Colonies?
We used to get more Colonists coming over, I wonder what stops them?
It's nice having the Big Folk around. They are more intimidating against Outsiders.
The Big Folk may not seem as much, but Bree would not be the same without them.
