We have no room for the likes of you in @!
We've dealt with Ruffians like you before, #!
I knew those Ruffians coming up the Greenway were up to no good!
How did you slip past the gatekeeper?
I have been in barfights more intimidating than you!
Call for the guards, we're under attack!
Did somebody do your head in?
What is the matter with you, acting like that!
There is no room for ill-folk such as you in Bree!
Good news everybody! This gentleman's room has just opened up, already paid for!
No thank you, your weird antics are bad for business, out!
Away with you, vile beggar!
Go sleep in the mud, drunkard! I don't want the likes of you in @!
And here I thought you'd make for good company!
Free drinks for whoever lands a hit on this Ruffian!
I look forward to watching you get dragged through the mud by the guards, #!
Get out of @, you Ruffian!
