I don't like you. Go away.
Mother told me not to talk to strange people like you.
Go away, #!
You're a nasty person.
You're scary.
You're one of those Big Folk ruffians. Leave me alone!
You better run or I'll call my father to get you!
The Big Folk will take care of you!
I won't talk with weird strangers!
I don't like scary strangers!
