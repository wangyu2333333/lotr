We have no room for the likes of you in Bree!
Flee to the hills, to the rest of your kind!
We've dealt with Ruffians like you before, #!
Begone, before we send the hounds after you!
I knew those Ruffians coming up the Greenway were up to no good!
How did you slip past the gatekeeper?
To the midges with you!
I have been in barfights more intimidating than you!
Call for the guards, we're under attack!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
Did somebody do your head in?
What is the matter with you, acting like that!
There is no room for ill-folk such as you in Bree!
Mind your own business, Ruffian.
I have fought Little Folk tougher than you!
You fight like one of them Little Folk.
