We have no room for the likes of you in Bree!
We've dealt with Ruffians like you before, #!
I knew those Ruffians coming up the Greenway were up to no good!
How did you slip past the gatekeeper?
Call for the guards, we're under attack!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
What is the matter with you, acting like that!
There is no room for ill-folk such as you in Bree!
Your first mistake was thinking I never fought Big Folk before!
For Big Folk, you don't hit that hard.
I've tossed with Dwarves before, this is nothing!
