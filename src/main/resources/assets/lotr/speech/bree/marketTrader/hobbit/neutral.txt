Sorry, we are not selling right now. Come back another time.
We've closed shop for the moment, sorry.
We're out of stock, try again later.
For now, I am only selling to other Bree-folk.
I don't know your business, but I want none of it.
Whatever business you have here, you can take it up to Deadmen's Dike with the other Southerners.
