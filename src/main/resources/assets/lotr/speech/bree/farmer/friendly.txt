You're not one of them Rangers, are you?
It's been raining a lot lately, have you noticed?
If you are here for our excellent pipe-weed, we grow them on the southern slopes.
First those Black Riders, now you. What a strange time.
If you are in need of a supply of pipe-weed, you came to the right land!
Not a lot of people know this, but Bree was the first to discover pipe-weed.
Don't let those Shirefolk tell you they invented smoking pipe-weed. Bree-folk did it before Old Toby did.
You don't happen to be interested in some Southlinch, are you?
I'm originally from Archet, a smaller community in Chetwood.
Combe is all right, but I prefer Bree-hill myself.
Every time the Dwarves come by, our coffers are filled with gold and our casks are empty of ale.
It has been raining an awful lot here lately...
There's an old saying here in Bree: when the rain comes, strange folk follow.
Rain, rain, rain. Nothing but rain here in Bree. What I would not do for some sun, instead.
They say when it rains the best tales are told over a flagon of ale.
Bree-hill has been our home since the first Men came here.
I like having the Little Folk around, they help with tending to the crops.
Bree has long survived on the patronage of Dwarves and Men, and of course the Little Folk.
I'm worried the rain will ruin the upcoming harvest.
You'll only get the freshest of crops with me.
Looking to buy some extra hands to tend to your lands?
Are you looking for extra hands, or for what the harvest has brought in?
Bree-landers are hard workers, I guarantee it!
After an incident years ago, we no longer let people hire the Little Folk. It's for their protection, you see.
The finest hard-working hands of Bree, at your service!
We don't just tend to Southlinch, we tend to other crops too!
