Glad to have you in command, #.
Together, we can make sure Bree stays proper!
We don't need Rangers to protect us, do we? No, we got this all covered. Just you and me.
I'm happy we still have decent folk like you leading the people of Bree, #.
What is it? Ruffians? Rangers? Orcs?
You give the order, #, we'll take care of the rest.
I'm keeping an eye out for any suspicious behaviour. You'll hear from me if I find anything.
If I could choose between following you and gate duty, well, here I am!
Proud to be at your service, sir!
Nothing to report, or are you here to report something, #?
I will follow your orders, #!
Are we going to tumble with them Ruffians again?
Things have been better since you've been in command, sir.
Just wondering, do we get paid by arrest, or the hour?
