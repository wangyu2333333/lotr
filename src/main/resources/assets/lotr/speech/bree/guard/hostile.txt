We have no room for the likes of you in Bree!
We've dealt with Ruffians like you before, #!
Begone, before we send the hounds after you!
I knew those Ruffians coming up the Greenway were up to no good!
To the midges with you!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
There is no room for ill-folk such as yourself in Bree!
A chance for the Men of Bree to show our quality!
We have been here far longer than you have, and will remain here for far longer than you will be remembered!
I knew those Rangers were worthless! No matter, I will stop you!
No need to call the guards, I am the guard!
You'd better leave these peaceful lands, Ruffian!
The barrows will soon see a new grave!
