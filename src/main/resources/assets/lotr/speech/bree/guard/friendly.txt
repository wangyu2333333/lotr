Nothing to see here, just go about your business.
Some say the Rangers are the real defenders of Bree, but why don't we ever see them defend us then?
Nothing gets past me unseen or unheard, #. Just so you know.
You'll be safe in Bree, #.
Any news from the Greenway, #?
I don't like the amount of Outsiders coming up the Greenway these days.
I've heard rumours of a great evil that has returned in the East. I hope it stays away from Bree.
We've been getting more reports of Orcs in the Lone-lands.
Be sure to stop by the Forsaken Inn if you plan on heading East, #.
Stay on the roads, friend. Things lurk in the dark.
Beware the barrows West of here, they've got an eerie presence about them.
Welcome to the land of Bree, Outsider.
Be careful around those Rangers in the wild, they're uncanny.
If you seek for a place to stay, there is no better place than the Prancing Pony!
I don't trust those Southerners, where do they plan on going? I hope not here.
First those Black Riders, now you. What a strange time.
I never see those Rangers do anything useful, I can't tell if that means they are that good or that lazy.
Last week I had the gatekeeper shift. I hope I never have to do that again.
My brother is a gatekeeper, my father was a proud guard too. We are all guards in my family.
I don't think there is any town as great as Bree.
Do you plan to visit the Colonies? I heard they have good food there.
