Big Folk, Little Folk, I've got wares for all!
Outsider, you would not want to miss the opportunity to look at Bree's finest, would you?
Best wares of Bree, right here!
I'm in the mood for a good trade, how about you?
The best the Men of Bree can produce, all for a sharp low price!
Best ironworks this side of Bree-hill, what can I do for you?
Horseshoes, bits and bridles, gardening tools, I can work iron into something you can work with!
A pound of iron, a piece of silver, as long as I can work with it!
Weapons are not my speciality, but I can help you with the essentials.
Forging is what I've done all my life, and I plan to teach my children the same.
Your requests are far more reasonable than the requests I get from the Dwarves.
I may not know how to work the steel of Elves or Dwarves, but iron! Iron I can work with!
What did he say again... the forge's fire is ashen-cold? That makes no sense.
Hammer, shape me a sturdy sword!
