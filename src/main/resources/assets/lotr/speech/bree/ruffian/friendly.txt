We look after one-another. Don't we, #?
Our allies are gathering in the North, hidden amongst the refugees.
Any word from Sharkey?
Any word from the Boss?
Keep an eye out on the road, I heard some important folks might come by soon.
Stay on the roads, friend. The wilderness is sprawling with those Rangers.
Find some comfort, keep an open ear, report what you uncover to me.
We ain't thugs, you hear. We are just putting our money on the future.
Keep your head low, and don't get caught by the guards of Bree.
Those Little Folk are sneaky, be sure you don't get tailed.
I'll be moving up to Deadmen's Dike soon.
Ah, #. I see you've made it to Bree.
I heard the old fortress is being repurposed as a hideout, if you are in grave need.
Our scouts knew you were coming. You should do better to move about unnoticed.
Can I help you? Sorry, I don't sell pipe-weed at the moment.
The weather sure is sinister these days.
You got any new information on Baggins? The Black Riders are getting impatient.
I heard some of those rangers talk about a place called Fornost. I think they are onto us.
