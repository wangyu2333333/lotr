Anyone step out of line?
What's the command, #?
Give me my orders and split up, we don't want to raise suspicion.
You tell me what to do, I'll get it done.
Ready to enforce some cooperation?
They won't even know what hit them.
Just give the word, I am ready.
We moving to the Shire anytime soon?
I could use a little bit more rumble and tumble, #.
I'm ready to get my hands dirty, what do you need me to do?
Glad to have you in command, #.
What are we up to today? Bullying Halflings, or intimidating the Men?
Tell me what to do, and you can consider it done, #.
