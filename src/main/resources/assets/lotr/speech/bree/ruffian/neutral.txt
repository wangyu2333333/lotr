What are you looking at?
I don't think I can help you, move along.
Why are you looking at me funny? Can't you see I'm busy?
Another refugee, or are you here with a different purpose?
How's the rain treating you?
Who are you again? It's my business to know who comes and goes around Bree-land.
You don't look like the type I normally do business with, why are you here?
I see they're letting anyone inside Bree these days.
Move along unless you have something to tell to my face.
A newcomer? Interesting...
