I'd just like a chat, come 'ere!
Why don't you just lie down and make this easier for both of us!
Look, it's nothing personal. Sharkey just wants a few words with you.
It's not warmongering, it's just good business.
You and your little friends will all soon be shackled and enslaved anyway!
We don't need your kind around here, #.
Bandit? Oh no, I am far more refined than your average highwayman.
I don't need your cash, but it make for a fine bonus reward.
Where were you going to run? I've got friends all over Eriador!
Looking for the Grey Wanderer? We don't need that funny business around here.
Times are tough enough as it is, you need to leave!
You came from the Shire, didn't you? Good to know.
You're not a threat to our cause, #!
The Boss would love to meet you, aye!
