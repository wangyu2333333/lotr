We have no room for the likes of you in Bree!
Flee to the hills, to the rest of your kind!
We've dealt with Ruffians like you before, #!
Begone, before we send the hounds after you!
I knew those Ruffians coming up the Greenway were up to no good!
Don't come bringing trouble to our peaceful village, why you.
There is no room for ill-folk such as you in Bree!
I don't even need my men to handle you.
The midges are more of a threat than you.
