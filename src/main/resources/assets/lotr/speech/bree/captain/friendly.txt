Ah, #! How are things out there?
You need any assistance, #?
Are those Southerners causing any issue?
Whatever is going on in the South, I hope it doesn't reach our community.
What is it? Do you need me to ring the town bell?
It's almost harvesting season, we could use a few more men to keep a look-out.
Pardon me for being blunt, #, but I am glad that you aren't one of them Ruffians.
Keep an eye out for those Ruffians if you can.
Word's been getting around about them Black Riders, have you seen them?
Any troubling news you ought to tell me, #?
