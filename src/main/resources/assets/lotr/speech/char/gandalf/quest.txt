Are you looking to share in an adventure, #? There are a great many adventures to be had here, but the world is wide and full of all manner of dangers... so allow me to give you some advice first!
Excellent! Now, I have a few odds and ends for you here.
This book you shall find particularly useful. Open it up and look inside!
The Red Book is a journal of your adventures. All kinds of folk all around Middle-earth will want help with tasks both large and small. They may even reward you for it!
Now you must learn to read a map. For Middle-earth is a very wide world indeed, and any decent adventurer must know how to find their way around.
Middle-earth is full of peoples both fair and foul... and, depending on how you conduct yourself, those peoples may count you as a friend, or fear you as an enemy.
Now, your alignment meter shows your standing with the peoples of Middle-earth. You ought to familiarise yourself with it, young #.
What's next? Ah, yes. The faction guide can tell you more about all those groups... their friends, foes, and areas of influence.
Of course, there is much to do in Middle-earth. You will learn more about the world through your adventures.
Hmm... why, I almost forgot! Take these old bags along with you. I suspect you shall have greater need of them than I.
Well, I do believe that's all I have to tell you, and now I must be on my way. Good day to you, #!
