I am looking for someone to share in an adventure...
Good morning!
Good morning, #!
Late? Oh no, #. A Wizard is never late.
Hmm...
Hmmph...
In these parts, it is very difficult to find anyone at all who wants to share in an adventure.
How is old Bilbo doing these days? I wonder...
You remember me, don't you? Old Greybeard, yes...
It is not our part to master the tides of the world.
You remember my name, don't you?
Ahh... #! So that is what you have taken to calling yourself.
Make for the village of Bree, seven days from now. There is something we must discuss.
Now, #, let us meet at Bree seven days hence. There is a matter of great urgency.
You do know my name, young #, even if you don't remember that I belong to it.
Many are my names in many countries.
