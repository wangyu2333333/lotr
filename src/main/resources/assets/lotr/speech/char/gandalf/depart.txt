Now I must be on my way. Farewell, #!
I expect I shall see you again before long. But for now, farewell.
Good day to you, #!
Good day! Until we meet again, I suppose...
Hmm... well, #, I must be on my way.
I must see to some other business now. May our paths cross again.
The wide world has need of me. Farewell, #.
I must return to the long road ahead. Farewell, #!
