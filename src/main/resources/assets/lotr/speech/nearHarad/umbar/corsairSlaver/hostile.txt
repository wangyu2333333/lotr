There's plenty of room for ye in that cage!
I was waiting for a new shipment. Must be you then!
I've broken men twice as large as ye!
Ye'll do fine on the Gulfing farms!
Really now, ye seek to free me slaves? Bleedin' lubbers!
Land-rats don't get a say in how we trade!
Yer attempt at freein' the slaves will end up with ye as one of 'em, #!
Ye ain't no better than us!
I'll be sure to set ye off on one o' our Corsair ships!
Ye calling me a sea-dog? Ye have no right!
I love me a volunteer slave!
Ye're bold to show yer face round here, #.
