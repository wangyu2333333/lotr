You ain't worth the work the slaves put into these crops!
Oh, suddenly you feel like you're better than us, #?
Here I am, treating you with respect as a northerner, and what do I get?
What a foolish act! The heat must've gotten to you!
Ey, stop this criminal, before something's stolen!
My farm is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Folks like yourself make me sick, ruining a peaceful trade!
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade! 
You've got no place in these lands!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade's off, but you'll pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You're not welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
Aha, a new slave for my collection!
You've gone mad!
Ah, #. You're a fool!
Even if I beat you into submission, you'd be of no worth to me!
They say Adûnâim live longer. Does that mean I get more profit out of enslaving you?
When I'm done with you, you'll envy the skeletons.
Umbar'll never let you get away with this!
