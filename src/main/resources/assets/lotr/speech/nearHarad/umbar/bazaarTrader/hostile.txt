Perhaps you should be the one to call the guards, ey?
Our cities will shake off your petty assault!
It took me great silver to get these goods. You won't take them from me!
Aye, I'm a thief. Won't mean I tolerate another!
The Gondorians don't deserve them trinkets, and neither do you!
I'll rather return all of these to the sea than give them up to you!
I'm trading, would you tick off?
Could you bother someone else with your foolery?
You've travelled all this way, but for what? I ain't trading with an enemy of Umbar!
If the Men of Gondor are your allies, you're my enemy, #!
I shall not trade my wares or silver with you. Sell your wretched goods elsewhere!
The silver of Umbar ain't finding its way into your hands, #!
There ain't nothing for the likes of you to buy here!
I ain't selling to the scum of Gondor!
You'll get no goods from me, #!
Off with you, Gondorian scum!
Begone from these lands, #! Your kind is not welcome here!
Off with you, #!
No business for you!
Begone, villain from the North!
You're an enemy of Umbar, #!
Stop this fellow, before something is stolen!
Northerners! Someone, call the guards!
You'll pay with blood, northerner!
My shop is closed. I shan't do any business with you!
Let us barter and live in peace, troublemaker!
Your kind makes me sick! Ruining a peaceful bazaar!
Have you got no respect for unarmed citizens?
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade!
Leave now, and never come back!
