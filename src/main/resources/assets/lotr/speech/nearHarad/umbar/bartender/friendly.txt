Raise your drinks, in honour of the sea!
You're in need of a drink, #? Course, I can arrange that!
Here to warm up, or cool off?
You're not from around here, are you? Well, you're welcome nonetheless!
Stay a while and listen to the tales those Corsairs bring along!
Got any tales of your own, #? We love hearing them.
You look like you need something stiff!
Sorry, but the real good stuff I keep saved for special occasions.
Loosen those lips with the sweet sting of alcohol, #!
Aother one? Are you sure? Har, just joking!
I'll crack open a new barrel, just for my new friend.
Oh, do you mean to sell? Right then.
Keep your weapons in their sheaths, and we should be fine.
I wouldn't wear a helmet indoors, but to each their own, ey?
Welcome to my tavern, @!
Welcome to @, my friend!
Welcome! Please, make yourself comfortable!
To the death of all Gondorians!
Here's to another battle!
Even Corsairs are welcome in my tavern, as long as they pay!
Another renegade, are you? Tell me all about it!
All sailors come to drink in @! Well, not around this time of year, course.
Here's to the ruin of Gondor, ey?
Here's to all souls lost at sea!
Came here to forget, or remember?
Well, if you're looking for a good drink, you've come to the right place!
This is @! Finest tavern in all the land!
