What is it that you command, #?
I'm at your service, commander.
Tell me what to do, and I will see it done.
I'm proficient in all forms of combat, #.
No matter the weapon I use, I'll see to it that the blood of your enemies flows.
Where're we off to next then?
We Umbarim are excellent fighters, ey?
Give me the word, and I shall burn your enemies' lands.
I'm not familiar with that formation.
Form a line? What good will that do?
I'm bestowed with the strength of a thousand men, so there ain't an army on earth that can best us.
We'll see this war to an end, #.
Aye, commander. Good to see that wound healing up.
It's an honour to fight for you, #.
I'd march for days if you wanted me to.
I'll be keeping my guard up, don't you worry.
We've been fighting Adûnâim for years. I'll show you how we do it.
Aye, whatever you say, I'll see done!
We'd be making a pretty penny if we enslaved them, too!
For Umbar!
For the Havens! For Umbar!
