Slavery? It's what they deserve.
I don't care where ye're from, #. If ye want to buy me slaves, all ye need is coin.
Reputation don't do much for me, so what about silver instead, ey?
Everyone can be bought, #. Literally, in our case.
If ye've got a mind to buy these lads and set 'em free, we'll get our hands on 'em again quick enough.
These men are broken. They'll do anything ye ask of them!
I got this fresh batch from Pinnath Gelin. I'll give them to ye at a fair price.
Aye, I used to be from the North meself. Turned out that them renegades had it right all along.
Are ye here to buy, or just to enjoy the view? Fine by me either way.
I can tell ye're looking for some strong workers. I got them!
It ain't just Adûnâim scum we've broken for ye, but the savage Southerners, too!
Aye, there's some southerners in there, but they work just as hard as yer usual Gondorians.
Ey, don't feel bad for them. They're better of in yer hands than mine.
Got some of these from the jungles. Weird place, that is.
Aye, I get all me slaves from the coasts of foreign lands!
I won't ask any questions if ye won't either.
I see you found me tents. Welcome to the slave-trade, #.
Aye, I got some slaves for sale. Interested?
Ey, #, touching means buying!
I don't care what ye do to me slaves, #. Not here to be asking questions.
Aye, I broke them all right.
You must have known me from the black tents. Aye, that happens.
Heard good things about me boys off them farmers, have you?
