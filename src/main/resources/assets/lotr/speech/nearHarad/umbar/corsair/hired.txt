What is it that ye command, #?
I'm at yer service, cap'n.
Tell me what to do, and I'll see it done.
I'm skilled in all forms of combat, #. Pro-fi-cient.
No matter the weapon I use, I'll see to it that the blood of yer enemies flows.
Where're we off to next, then?
We Corsairs are bleedin' good fighters, ey?
Give me the word, and I shall burn yer enemies' lands.
I'm not familiar with that formation.
Form a line? What good'll that do?
I'm bestowed with the strength of a thousand men, so there ain't an army on earth that can best us.
We'll see this war to an end, #.
Aye, cap'n, good to see that wound healing up.
It's an honour to fight with ye, cap'n.
I'd march for days if ye wanted me to.
I'll be keeping me guard up, don't ye worry.
I'm ready to plunder, #!
When we fighting them Gondorians again?
Can we keep some of that loot, #?
Aye, fair share among the crew, right?
Leave the wives to me, #.
I'd rather be on a ship, but whatever yer command is, cap'n.
Can we visit the sea every now and then, cap'n?
Ey, those who survive can be slaves on the docks.
