Come here! I'll tear you apart!
You've led yourself into some dire circumstances, #!
My blade's all rusty just for you!
We've been fighting your kind for generations. There's no way you can stop us!
Khôrumor, guide my strike!
Phôinûr's work shall not be undone by the likes of you!
The gates of Umbar shall not be broken!
I'll smite you back to the North!
Umbar will remain free, you northern rat!
Maybe you should be the one to call the guards, ey?
Our cities will outlast your petty assault!
Where's Lord Sauron's assistance when we need it?
You think you're getting away with that? Must be one of the dumbest northerners I've met!
Aye, I can smell that filthy Aphûr-lâi stink wherever you go!
I've been drinking, but even four of you won't be a problem!
