Come 'ere, I'll tear ye a new one!
It'll be a watery grave for you!
I'm so angry, I lost my accent!
Come 'ere, ye land-rat!
When I'm done with ye, you'll be thirty feet under and sinkin'!
Me blade's all rusty just for you!
All that water swirlin' around in yer head!
The way ye're walking, can't help but think yer just a poor lubber!
I'm sure ye think I'm just a sea-dog, don't ye? Well, you'll be surprised!
Azrubêl, guide me strike!
I'll fight you to a watery grave!
Ye must be from that port I plundered. Not had enough, have ye?
Aye, look at that, a rebel!
By Azrubêl, this lubber thinks he can beat me in combat!
The waves take ye! Nothing can withstand me might!
Lubbers always think they stand a chance, don't they?
Foul seaweed piece o' land-rat that ye are!
I'll be sure to scrub you o'er the corals, filth!
Bleedin' barnacle-head o' a mother's rotten canyon, I'll stab ye dead!
May the fish feed on yer rotten corpse, #!
Ye think ye're getting away with that? Ye must be one of the dumbest lubbers I've met!
Aye, I knew ye'd betray us. Could smell that filthy Adûnâim stink wherever ye walked!
I've been round Topaz Bay. Ye can't do me any worse than what the Gulfings tried!
Any last words for yer old love before I show her what's happened to ye?
I've been drinkin', but even four of ye won't be a problem!
Come 'ere, ye useless lubber!
Come an' get what ye deserve, ye stinkin' lubber!
