The other Haradrim don't know how to forge, I tell you.
Bronze weaponry is too weak if you ask me.
Are you a Corsair looking for some gear for on the seas, or something a bit more... landlocked?
Aye, I think I could forge that for you.
Always happy to trade with another one who knows what the right cause is.
There's no better forge anywhere else in Harad, I can guarantee you.
I don't care where you got them coins from, #. As long as you pay, I won't be asking questions.
Be sure to keep your weapons proper. The salty air might try to bite at them.
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
I'm always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my weapons are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my weapons, #.
