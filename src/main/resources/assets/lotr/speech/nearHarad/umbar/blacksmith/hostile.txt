Perhaps you should be the one to call the guards, ey?
Took a mighty long time to forge these scimitars. You won't take them from me!
Could you bother someone else with your troublemaking?
Be off, before I strike you with my blazing hammer!
The only scimitar fit for you would be one embedded in your gut!
I would not trade with you, even if all my coffers lay empty!
No trade for you, #!
You've got the stink of Gondor about you!
I don't know how you made it past our warriors, but your path ends here!
You'll pay with blood, northerner!
Are the green lands not enough for you? Begone!
