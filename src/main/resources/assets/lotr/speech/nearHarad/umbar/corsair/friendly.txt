Fled from Gondor, have ye? If you 'ave, you're welcome here.
I can smell the stench of the North on ye. What's your business 'ere?
Ship's going North soon. Are ye comin' with us, #?
Plenty o' towns and ships going around the Bay o' Bêl to raid.
Bleedin' Adûnâim up north think they got it all right. Well they ain't, #!
Swear I spotted one of them stone-people that roam near Andrast once. Kept staring straight at our ship, it did!
Stay south o' Tolfalas if ye intend to raid some of them fisher-folk, #.
Here to work, are ye? We can always use more hands on our ships.
Did ye come by road or by ship?
Aye, I visited Ain an-Ahâr. Ain't that special, really.
Every time I sail out, I still pray to Azrubêl for a safe return.
I love me some good plunder and pillage, #.
Slavery? It's what they deserve.
Won't ever tire from that scent of the sea. Makes me feel at home.
We use the stars to navigate on the high seas. Only thing you can be sure of these days!
Ain't no fooling me, #. I'll cut you down where you stand.
Them foams of the water are just as welcome to me as them foams of a good cider!
I want to go out fighting again. Been too long!
Sauron ain't that bad a guy, really.
We rule the seas. Gondor don't stand a chance.
Ever seen the red sands, #? They're far east, beyond Khopazûl.
Ye, them mercenaries will fight for ye, but will they share their plunder with ye?
Aye, I've been in a great battle at sea. Nothing makes ye more dedicated to the cause than the fear of drownin'!
I wish we could have another beauty like Barûphel leadin' us.
I once led a raid on Dol Amroth, but it ain't as safe now. Them Swan Knights have wised up.
We long since abandoned the Adûnâim bloodlines. Made us stronger too, aye.
By Azrubêl, ye're a strange one, ain't ye?
We'll be off to fetch another load of slaves soon.
