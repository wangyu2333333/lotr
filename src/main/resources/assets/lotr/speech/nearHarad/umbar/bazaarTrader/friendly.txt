Anfalas has the best spots to go fetch some Gondorians for the market.
I ain't sailing North no more. Been trading with the Gulfings instead. 
Aye, I visited Ain an-Ahâr. Ain't that special, really.
Furthest inland I've been would be Ajtiaz an-Ahâr.
Aye, I've sold off some slaves in my time. What of it?
I just got all of these from a fresh plunderin' trip.
Want some of my spoils, #?
Aye, I can part with some of these. What'd you like?
It won't come cheap, you know? We had to fish some of these things out of shipwrecks.
If you're looking for slaves, they'd be halfway across the Arênin by now.
You seem like the type who'd know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I interest you in some of my wares?
I'm always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Ay, have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something in my wares that'll interest you, #!
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
Greetings, #! Come, see the beauty of the wares I brought along!
What is it that you wish to buy? For I sell treasures from all over the world!
I'm prepared to barter silver with you, #. What is it that you're needing?
Welcome to the bazaar, #! What can I offer you today?
Stolen treasures from the ends of the earth, for just a few silver coins!
Welcome, #! Welcome! I offer you many fine goods from other lands!
For a few silver coins, I can sell you some of our loot!
Welcome to my stall! What can I get you?
I offer you many treasures from many lands!
Used to be a Corsair, I did. Can still fight too, aye.
Should go back to being a Corsair. That always paid much better than these bleedin' bazaars.
