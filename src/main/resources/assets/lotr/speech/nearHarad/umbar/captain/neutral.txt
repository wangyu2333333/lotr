Perhaps you'd be better off asking those Gulfings for men.
No thanks. My men don't follow those of empty promises.
No men of mine would follow you, #. You reek of Gondor an' the North.
You come from Gondor, #. We ain't that blind.
I'm sorry, but we can't risk passing our commands to strangers.
With your poor reputation, I wouldn't even care if you were a Black Adûnôn.
You might have more luck trying the Corsairs, or the mercenaries. But not these true-blooded men of Umbar.
I don't see why anyone would follow you, #.
We ain't as simple as the Corsairs, #. I won't let you lead my men to their death.
You seem like a renegade to me, not a leader.
