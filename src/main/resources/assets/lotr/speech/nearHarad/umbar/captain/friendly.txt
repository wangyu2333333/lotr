Go! Lead our men to the dawn of a world without Northlings!
I hope you do these men right by letting them fight on the front lines.
Be careful, #. They get rowdy if you don't let them fight.
Ah, #. I do have some recruits ready for the field. Take a look!
You better leave some for me, #!
Aye, if you've got the coin, you can buy some men off of me.
Feel free to lead my men into the heart of Gondor, #.
Honestly, the men I have with me prefer to stick to land.
My men are much more loyal than those Azûlim, #.
Fresh warriors, ready for hire!
Here to hire more of my warriors, #?
I have a few fresh recruits who would do well under your command, #.
If you seek battle with the Gondorians, you would not find finer men than my own.
Word has spread of your deeds, #. My men would be honoured to fight alongside you.
Do you seek to command the mighty warriors of Umbar?
Word of your deeds has spread quickly in our lands. It would be an honour for my men to serve you!
My men are strong and mighty warriors. Do you seek to hire some?
Don't be fooled, #. The Northerners are quick to use you for their own aims.
These warriors have a few tricks up their sleeves, #.
Be sure to leave some for the rest of us.
I can grant you the command of a few of my men.
With my men under your banner, the Aphûr-lâi will surely flee!
You have proven yourself to me, #. Go! Lead our men to battle!
