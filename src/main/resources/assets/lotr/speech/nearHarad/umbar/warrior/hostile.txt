You've led yourself into some dire circumstances, #!
We've been fighting your kind for generations. There's no way you can stop us!
Lord Sauron, guide my strike!
Phôinûr's work shall not be undone by the likes of you!
Khôrumor's work shall not be undone by the likes of you!
The gates of Umbar shall not be broken!
I'll smite you back to the North!
Umbar will remain free, you northern rat!
Northerners always think they stand a chance!
Yes, flee back to the North!
Come here, Gondorian scum!
You've no business being here, #!
For Umbar!
