You seem all right, #. But what guarantee do I have?
Aye, I'd rather miss out on a potential trade than lose my hands to the guards for trading with a Gondorian.
Are you really a friend of Umbar, #? I can't tell yet.
I'll sell you the wares them Corsairs bring back if I can't use them.
I'd rather hold out a while before I be selling you anything.
I ain't about to sell my steel to anyone who might be a friend of Gondor.
I ain't the easy-tricked type, #. I need my proof before I trade with you.
You don't smell of fish. Doesn't seem like you're from these parts.
We've been fighting off Adûnâim for generations. Ain't going to risk selling weapons to one!
Aye, just like Barûphel, my scimitars are a beauty. But they ain't going to marry a nobody, are they?
My hammer doesn't work for them land-rats, does it?
