All these crops are brought to you by the finest slaves, #!
My slaves worked day and night to get you these goods.
Oh, well yes, these are produced by enslaved Gondorians, why do you ask?
Fresh goods from the land! Come get 'em here!
Ah, #! Need any provisions for your journeys?
Looking to work the land? I could always use another worker.
I promise you, my slaves are the most dedicated workers in all Umbar!
I get my workers from the Corsairs. They often bring some eager foreigners back from their raids, display cages and all!
Look for the black tents. They belong to the slavers who sell Gondorian scum.
The Great Serpent values those who work hard, #. This is why the slaves do so well.
You seem like the type who'd know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Care for some of my crops?
I'm always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my crops are THAT good!
You've got an eye for detail, right? Take a closer look at the quality of my crops, #.
Greetings! Have you come to trade with me?
I'm sure I've something among my wares that'll interest you, #.
A good trader never says no to another trade.
That's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I've got to make a living.
If Lord Sauron can have Gondorian slaves, why can't we?
