You're ruining the atmosphere!
Your presence is rousing my guests!
You're no guest of mine. Begone, you rat!
You'll not get anything from my tap, #!
Are you one of them... renegades? They always cause trouble!
Can someone fetch me a better weapon?
How rude are you, to walk in here as a friend of those Ad청n창im?
Drunkards and seashells, what do you think you're doing?
By the arak! So hostile!
I have no more words for you, #!
Your downfall, another tale to add to the legend of @!
You better start running, before I climb over this bar!
I'll crack a goblet over your head!
Run! Go ahead!
Can't you just leave us be?
I thought we made it clear that Aph청r-l창i aren't welcome!
Let me teach you why we Southrons'll win the war with Gondor!
You must be one of those fancy folk the Corsairs keep shouting about!
You must be a lost slave. Let me remind you of your place!
All right, that's enough! Out with you before you throw up on my bar!
