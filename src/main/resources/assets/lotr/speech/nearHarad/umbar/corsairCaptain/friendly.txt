Been sailing with these men for many fine years. Ye won't find any better, #!
They've got the scent of silver, #. They'll find the money in every port!
Have ye brought the silver to pay me men?
Aye, we don't care that much which side ye're on. Just don't cross us and we should be fine.
Me men are sworn to silver, not to Sauron.
There be no rules, just guidelines for these men.
Have ye got a ship to lead them on, #? The boys do best on a fine ship.
I can hear the silver clinking in yer pockets, like music to me ears!
Finest sea-dogs ye can find. Also know how to deal with unruly slaves.
Ye better leave some for me, #!
Aye, if you've got the coin, ye can buy some men off of me.
Be careful, #. These men get rowdy if you don't let them fight.
