I can smell the stench of the North on you. What's your business here?
Bleedin' Adûnâim up North think they've got it all right, well they've not, #!
Stay clear of the shores of the Swan, #. They're crawling with fighting Gondorians.
Stay south of Tolfalas if you intend to raid some of them fisher-folk, #.
Did you come by road or ship?
I don't care that much for Sauron, but I'll gladly fight alongside his Urîk if they'll help us kill the Adûnâim.
We're never letting Gondor take Umbar again, #.
We're too strong to ever fail against those Adûnâim now.
I love some good plunder and pillage, #.
Slavery? It's what they deserve.
There's no fooling me, #. I'll cut you where you stand.
I want to go out fighting again. Been too long!
We ain't as brutish as those Aphûr-lâi claim we are.
I won't rest 'til all the Aphûr-lâi are dead.
We rule the seas. Gondor doesn't stand a chance!
Yes, those mercenaries will fight for you, but will they share their plunder with you?
Bronze weaponry is far too weak if you ask me.
I wish we could have another beauty like Barûphel leading us.
We've got Umbar and Gâth-azrazâin, and old Ain, but up North even Osgiliath's in ruins now.
We long since abandoned the Adûnâim bloodlines. Made us stronger too, aye.
I don't trust those Corsairs, #. Make me feel uneasy, they do.
And where've you come from? Not Gondor, I hope.
Those rats up north call themselves Adûnâim, but we've got the real legacy of Anadûnê right here.
I'd stay right out of the way of those Corsairs if I were you.
Our friends inland think much of themselves, with their fancy cities, but there was a time when we ruled them all.
We're the real Adûnâim, #. And don't you forget it!
Lord Sauron is rising in the Land of Shadow. There'll be another war soon, I think.
