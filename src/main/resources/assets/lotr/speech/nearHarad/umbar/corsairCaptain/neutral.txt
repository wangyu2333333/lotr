Aye, it's true me men don't care that much who we work for, but we do have some standards, #.
I ain't gonna let a land-rat command me proud sea-hounds.
Don't see a lubber like yerself capable of handling me men.
There ain't no question about it, #. Were you on our ship ye'd be hangin' off a plank above the Athrassir.
Perhaps ye'd be better off trying them Gulfings.
Now I ain't saying ye're a Gondorian spy, but ye ain't a Corsair quite yet.
#, don't make it too easy for me, throwin' these insults at ye.
Ye're joking? I certainly hope ye're joking.
I heard some rumours you called us sea-dogs. Sort that out first, would ye?
No thanks, me lads don't follow faithless lubbers.
