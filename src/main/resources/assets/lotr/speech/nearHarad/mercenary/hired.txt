Yes, we borrow the weapons of our Northern friends, but we are far more capable warriors than they.
I bested the Forest-Men, I can best the Snake-Men. Anywhere where you lead me, I can best them.
The Snake-Men armed us. We will fight in return.
The Great Lion's power is at your command.
Guide me to the enemy, and I shall display my strength to you.
Still, the customs of the Snake-men confuse me. Why would you only pay me once? Oh well...
Take me to the colder lands, #.
Lead the hunt!
Now, we shall do some harm to the pale Men!
Do we set up camp here, #?
I hunt great beasts all across the Sunlands. Northern Men will be no trouble!
What are your orders?
Now I think of it, #, under what banner do you march?
I'm glad to leave that old camp behind me, #.
Any chance we could avoid the firestone lands?
The Flaming Eye works in mysterious ways, doesn't he?
We have always fought alongside the Snake-men, but any enemy of my enemy is my chief.
