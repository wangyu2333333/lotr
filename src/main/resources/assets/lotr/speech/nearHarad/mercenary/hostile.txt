I'll defeat you, in name of the Snake-men!
Great Serpent, allow me to strangle this attacker!
Great Lion, give me the courage and strength to smite this fool!
Flaming Eye, burn my opponent to ash!
I fought your kind before. I shall again long after you are gone!
I will drink from your skull!
Less talking, more bleeding!
That's a fine head you will lose from your shoulders!
Spear, dagger, axe and blade, I mastered them all!
Great Lion, show this pup the strength of the Sunlands!
Great Serpent, strangle my foe's kin, and poison their streams!
The Great Eye shall scour your people from the face of the earth!
Flee, scum!
You'd better start running, #. I love a good hunt!
I might just crush you with something blunt!
