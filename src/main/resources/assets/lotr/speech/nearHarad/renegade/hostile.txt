Away from me, you rogue!
Begone, enemy of the South!
You are no match for the might of Umbar!
Run back to Gondor, you coward!
Did they send you after me? Then they are greater fools than I knew!
You still fight for Gondor? You poor fool, #!
Only a coward of Gondor would be so foolish!
I shall smite you where you stand!
Fear the wrath of Lord Sauron!
Unwise, most unwise to come here, #!
