Raise your drinks in honour of Mulkhêr!
Here's to the gods! May they make our drinks twice as strong, and tomorrow's troubles twice as weak!
You in need of a drink, #? Of course I can arrange that!
Here to warm up, or cool off?
You're not from around here, are you? Well, you are welcome nonetheless!
Stay a while and listen to the tales travellers bring along!
Got any tales of your own, #? We love hearing them.
Once the day is over, let me tell you about the time Mulkhêr himself blessed my drinks!
My drinks are the best you'll get for your coin. Best in all the Gulf!
You look like you need something stiff!
Sorry, but the real good stuff I keep saved for special occasions.
Loosen those lips with the sweet sting of alcohol, #!
You and I look like we could become friends!
Drink until Mulkhêr goes to sleep!
Another one? Are you sure? Har, just joking!
I shall crack open a new barrel, just for my new friend.
Oh, do you mean to sell? Interesting.
Keep your weapons in their sheaths, and we should be fine.
I wouldn't wear a helmet indoors, but to each their own, right?
Welcome to @!
Welcome! Please, make yourself comfortable!
Mulkhêr is kind to all who embrace him, and so I will do the same.
You are welcome in @!
Welcome to #, my good friend!
All who serve the cause are welcome in @!
