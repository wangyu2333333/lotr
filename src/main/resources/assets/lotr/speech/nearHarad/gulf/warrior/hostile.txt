I will break you!
When I'm done with you, you'll never feel your skin again!
I shall crush your bones, one at a time!
Come on, then! I want to hear you scream.
I knew you were a filthy Corsair from Topaz Bay!
How were you able to slip past Arminazûl, then?
Mulkhêr, guide my strike! The battle begins!
The streams of Yaphurushi shall flow red with your blood!
You may have tricked the nomads into aiding you, but I can see through your disguise!
I will toss you over the Bridge of Arênin myself!
Away with you, desecrator!
May Mulkhêr strike you down, you savage!
Mulkhêr does not accept weak offerings. I shall just kill you!
To burn, to drown, to enslave? Ah, I shall just butcher you!
Run to the hills, pale-skin!
You won't be so tough when I am done with you, #!
I see fire in your future, #. Fire and sacrifice!
