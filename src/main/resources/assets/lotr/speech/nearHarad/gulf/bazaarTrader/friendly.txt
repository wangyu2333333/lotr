Mulkhêr seems to favour me, so you are lucky to be a friend of mine, #.
Khôpakadar always has been and always will be the greatest city on earth, #. Don't believe anything else.

Those who sail from Azûl talk about lands far beyond our reach.
I'm sure our rich waters are blessed with endless fish, #.

You're not from here, are you? I know how that feels, but don't be afraid!

The Town of Bones is a sight to behold, #.
Blessed are those who trade with me, #. Don't you want to know what that is like?
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
I am always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Greetings! Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something among my wares that'll interest you, #.
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
The prices? Ah well, these things are blessed by Mulkhêr himself, you see.
