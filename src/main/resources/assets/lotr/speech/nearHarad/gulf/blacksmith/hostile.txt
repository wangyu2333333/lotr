I heard the armies of the Ulugil pay good money for human skin!
And to think I almost invited you over for a talk!
All this effort, and you still resort to violence?
Oh, you want to trade blows? That's fine by me!
Desert sun and scorpion sting, your strike means nothing!
What a foolish act! The heat must have got to you!
Stop this criminal, before something is stolen!
My forge is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
The fires of Mulkhêr shall scorch your skin!
My forge is hotter than the pits of Ulug-zâin! My hammer is harder than the rocks of the fire-mountain!
You shall make a fine anvil for my hammer's blows!
I was growing tired of swinging this hammer at my anvil!
Out! Out and away, I tell you!
Mulkhêr blessed me and my weapons! You stand no chance!
Back to your ship, Corsair!
How shall you burn? The heat of my forge, or the burning sands!
