Mûmakil? I'm afraid you just missed them. They are travelling North as we speak.
Our warriors will win the war in the name of Mulkhêr.
Our fighters are blessed by Mulkhêr himself. Nothing will stop us.
The Gulfing blood is the thickest and strongest of them all, #.
When we are done, Gondor will be stricken from history!
Mulkhêr favours you, #. And my men shall do the same.
I will grant you command over a few of my men, in return for your services.
With my men under your banner, the Aphûr-lâi will surely flee!
You have proven yourself to me, #. Go! Lead our men to battle!
Be sure to leave some for the rest of us.
Unfortunately, we don't have any Mûmakil for you to ride right now.
