Together, we will fulfil the will of Mûlkher, #.
Our enemies shall face the wrath of Mûlkher.
I'll be sure to guard your life from any harm.
I will follow Mûlkher under your command, #.
What is it that you command, #?
I am at your service, commander.
Tell me what to do, and I will see it done.
I am skilled in all forms of combat, #.
No matter the weapon I wield, I will see to it that the blood of your enemies flows.
Where are we off to next?
We Haradrim are excellent fighters.
Give me the word, and I shall burn your enemies' lands.
I'm not familiar with that formation.
Form a line? What good will that do?
I am bestowed with the strength of a thousand men, so no army can outnumber us.
We will see this war to an end, #.
Ah, commander. Good to see that wound healing up.
It's an honour to fight for you, #.
I could march for days if you wanted me to.
I'll keep my guard up, don't you worry.
Perhaps you could leave one of them to me? I have a few things I want to try out.
Could we use their children as shields, #?
If only we had a Mûmak, we could just squash them.
You should see if you can get your hands on a Mûmak from the beast-chainers, #.
For the glory of Mûlkher!
