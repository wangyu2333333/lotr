All these crops are brought to you by the finest slaves, #!
My slaves worked day and night to get you these crops.
Oh, well yes, these are produced by enslaved Gondorians, why do you ask?
Fresh goods from the land! Come get them here!
Ah, #! Need any provisions for your journeys?
Looking to work the land? I could always use another worker.
I promise you, my slaves are the hardest workers in all the Gulf!
I get my workers from the sailors. They like to set up camps, display cages and all!
Look for the black tents. They belong to the slavers who sell land-workers.
Blessed are those who trade with me, #. Don't you want to know what that is like?
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my fruits?
I am always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my crops, #.
Greetings! Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something among my wares that'll interest you, #.
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
The prices? Ah well, these items are blessed by MulkhÃªr himself, you see.
