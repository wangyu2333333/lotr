Blessed are those who trade with me, #. Don't you want to know what that is like?
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
I am always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition is a drive for better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Greetings! Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something among my wares that'll interest you, #.
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
My forge has fires as hot as the pits of the South, #.
Even Mulkhêr himself would be jealous of my forging skill.
To call yourself a great smith, you first must have made at least a thousand daggers.
I can do all kinds of metalwork, #. What are you looking for?
I keep my forge outside. It's safer that way.
I would prefer you look with your eyes, not your hands, #.
Some say it is the warrior who is blessed. I say that Mulkhêr blesses the smiths and their weapons just as much, #.
