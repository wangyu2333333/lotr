My men will not follow a non-believer.
Perhaps we may speak after you have served at the temple, #.
You don't have nearly enough renown to command my men.
Please, fetch me my drink. Wait - you are not a slave?
And what deeds have you done, that you think you can command my men?
You will have to give a lot more than that before any of us will follow you, #.
MulkhÃªr guide me! Why is this pale-skin requesting arms?
The Sun must have addled your head if you think you are able to command my men.
Would you march north? I don't think so.
