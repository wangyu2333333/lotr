Have you come from Topaz Bay, or from further lands?
Mûmakil? I'm afraid you just missed them. They are travelling North as we speak.
Our warriors will win the war in the name of Mulkhêr.
Our fighters are blessed by Mulkhêr himself. Nothing will stop us!
Be watchful, #. Corsairs sometimes sail these waters.
The tower of Arminazûl keeps most outlaws at bay, but we can take care of those few who slip past.
The Gulfing blood is the thickest and strongest of them all, #.
I am amazed that the Bridge of Arênin still stands, with the weight of all the Mûmakil who cross over it.
The call of Lord Mulkhêr shall one day summon us all.
A quick blow to our enemies' heads? Seems rather dull to me.
When we are done, Gondor will be stricken from history.
We only do as Lord Mulkhêr desires, #.
I like to make an example of those who oppose me.
If Mulkhêr the Mighty demands blood, I shall deliver it to him.
I will be off marching North tomorrow.
Sorry, #. I'm too busy loading up my Mûmak to talk to you.
I hear another ship was raided near Topaz Bay. A shame.
Long ago, we built temples among the burning sands. But now they are all forgotten.
You probably are familiar with the heat of the desert, but have you ever heard of the fire-pits in the South?
I presume you are here to request that I bring you back a Gondorian slave from the North?
Do you march north with us, #? You seem capable enough to stand your own.
You aren't one of those sand-usurer scum, are you? I don't trust them at all.
I was deployed at Arminazûl, but now I am being called North.
I shall cut down the northerners with my lucky dagger, in the name of Mulkhêr the Mighty!
If you are scared, you can spend some time at our altars, #. They never fail to fill my spirit with courage.
I was once among the Corsairs of Topaz Bay, but I saw the errors of my ways.
Mulkhêr the Mighty has even tamed the great beasts of the South for us. No Men can stop us now!
