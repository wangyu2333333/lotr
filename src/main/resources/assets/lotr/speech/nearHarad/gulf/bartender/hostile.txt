You are ruining the atmosphere!
Your presence is chasing away my guests!
You are no guest of mine. Begone!
So, it for was your coming that MulkhÃªr watered down my drinks? I knew it had to be a sign!
You will not get anything from my tap, barbarian!
Are you a Corsair? They always cause trouble!
Can someone fetch the guards for me?
How rude are you, to walk in here as a criminal to our people?
Drunkards and patrons, what do you think you are doing?
By the arak! So hostile!
I have no more words for you, #!
Your downfall will be just another tale to add to the legend of @!
You had better start running before the mob gets here!
I'll crack a goblet over your head!
Run! Go ahead!
Can't you just leave us be?
This cloth is thick enough to have you suffocate!
I'll string you upside down and serve your blood as this week's special!
I always wanted to try to brew a drink from Northerner eyes!
The sign was clear, was it not? No dogs, no slaves, you are both!
Get out of @, you faithless villain!
Leave @ at once! Run back to the North!
