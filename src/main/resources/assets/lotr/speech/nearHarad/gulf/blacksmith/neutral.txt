I would not dare displease Mulkhêr by trading my weapons off to a stranger.
Sorry, only the devoted may wield what I have in stock.
What promise do I have that you won't use my weapons against me?
All my time and effort should not go towards arming a non-believer, #.
Come back when you have Mulkhêr's blessing to wield my weapons.
Join me at the temple tonight and I might reconsider trading with you tomorrow, #.
You really shouldn't pester me for goods that aren't meant to be yours.
I would welcome you, #, but my heart grows uneasy around a traveller from the North.
Be on your way, I have nothing I am willing to sell to you.
My apologies, but I can't trust you quite yet. Wouldn't want you using my weapons to do harm to my friends here.
I care for silver, but I'm not that desperate yet.
