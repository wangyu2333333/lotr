I knew you were a filthy Corsair from Topaz Bay!
Aha, a new slave for my collection!
Not even your skull could be of value to me now!
To the altar with you!
I can deal with those poachers of the South. You should be no problem!
Into the Gulf with you! Let your sins drag you down to the bottom!
You may have tricked the nomads into aiding you, but I can see through your disguise!
If you rolled the die of luck, this is a poor outcome for you!
Where are my mercenaries when I need them?
Your lack of faith has driven you mad!
Ah, #. This was a poor decision indeed!
Even if I beat you into submission, you would be of no worth to me!
I heard the armies of the Ulugil pay good money for Man-skin!
And to think I almost invited you over for a talk!
All this effort, and you still resort to violence?
Oh, you want to trade blows? That's fine by me!
Desert sun and scorpion sting, your strike means nothing!
What a foolish act! The heat must have got to you!
Stop this villain, before something is stolen!
My shop is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Scum like you make me sick, ruining a peaceful bazaar!
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade! 
You have no place in the Gulf!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
