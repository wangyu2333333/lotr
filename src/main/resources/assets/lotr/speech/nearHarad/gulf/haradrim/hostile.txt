I will break you!
When I'm done with you, you'll never feel your skin again!
No sacrifice is too great!
I shall crush your bones, one at a time!
Aha, a new slave for my collection!
And here I thought we could be friends!
To the altar with you!
One who can't obey should be treated like a dog!
You think you can challenge the blessed people of Mulkhêr? Har!
Into the Gulf with you! Let your sins drag you down to the bottom!
You may have tricked the nomads into aiding you, but I can see through your disguise!
You can't honestly think you stand a chance against Mulkhêr's sacred people?
Where are my mercenaries when I need them?
I will toss you over the Bridge of Arênin myself!
Ah, #. This was a poor decision indeed!
Your lack of faith has driven you mad!
Mulkhêr does not accept weak offerings. I shall just kill you!
I see fire in your future, #. Fire and sacrifice!
And to think I almost invited you over for a talk!
You will regret not praising Mulkhêr while you still could!
