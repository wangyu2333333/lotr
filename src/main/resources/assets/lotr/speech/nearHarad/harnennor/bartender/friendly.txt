Welcome, my good friend, to @!
Good day, my friend!
Welcome, #! What do you desire?
Surely you are thirsty after a hot day beneath the Sun!
You must be thirsty, my friend. What would you like?
Welcome to @. The finest watering-hole in all the lands of Ninz√¢yan!
You must be hungry, my friend.
We all need hearty food and drink in times like these.
Here at @, we drink arak as if we were fish.
A strong cup of my finest arak for you, perhaps?
Come in, my friend. Come and get out of the sun.
I suppose you shall be wanting something to eat.
I hope they do not call off too many of my patrons to fight for Lord Sauron.
You are not from around here, are you, #? But all Men enjoy some delicious arak!
Please, come and sit down.
Are you a farmer? Have you any goods to sell?
@. Best in all the land!
You must be thirsty, #. It is lucky you came here to @.
