My works have to go to my own people first, #.
I don't trust that you won't use my own work against me.
If I were seen giving wares to a northerner they'd cut my hands off. Sorry.
How will I know you won't pass this on to the Gondorians, #?
I don't think we're on good enough terms yet for me to show you my wares, #.
It's going to be a no from me.
