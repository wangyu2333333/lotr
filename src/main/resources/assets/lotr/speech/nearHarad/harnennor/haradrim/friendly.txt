Another day, another army. Will it ever be different?
You're a northerner? I'm surprised you made it this far without either side attacking you.
I hope the nomads set up again at Ijdi-ilel soon.
Have you seen the dark mountains, #?
I heard there has been trouble at Bêlkadar again. I pray we keep our hold on the Aphûrnin.
The fish have been biting this season. Maybe nobody has to starve, for once.
Have faith, #. Lord Sauron will make sure those northerners turn to ash, soon enough.
I heard rumours that riders from the East have come to Ninzâyan. What a time to be alive!
The nomads of the Great Desert promised to bring me back something special from across the sands.
I don't suppose you will be helping our warriors push further north, #?
Some of the men that came back from across the Aphûrnin say another river lies further north. I wonder if there are people like us up there.
The desert of Lostladen is a wasteland of ash and sand. Precious little can grow there.
Lord Sauron has promised us the coming of great warriors out of the South, who will crush the Gondorians with a single blow!
I heard the Men of Umbar still haven't left their waters. Will they ever commit to this war like us?
I hear the lands of Umbar are evergreen and filled with trees bearing many fruits. Why don't they ship some more up our way?
I used to work on a farm, #. Unfortunately, it was raided by the Gondorians when they reached the Aphûrnin.
Sand to the south, war to the north... is there any place for us to just be at peace?
You're a northerner, aren't you? I can tell. I always can.
I don't normally talk to the likes of you, but something tells me you're all right.
Hot day today, isn't it?
The serpent strangles the tree, #.
