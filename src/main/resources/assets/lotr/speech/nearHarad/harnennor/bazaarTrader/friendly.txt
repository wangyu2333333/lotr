All my wares are shipped in over the Aphûrnin. Come, take a look!
I only sell the best goods Ninzâyan can produce.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
Any friend of my friends is a friend of mine as well, and coins are my best friends!
I have a special offer in for you, brought across the desert by our nomad friends!
I don't care about profits, trust me. I just want you to be happy with the least price I can offer.
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Greetings. Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something that'll interest you, #!
A good trader never says no to another trade.
More interested in goods from the north? I might have a few lying around...
I got some of these goods from Ugrî-zadîn. Let me show you.
That glint in your eye - you are ready for a trade, yes?
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
You seem like the type who knows a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
I am always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
