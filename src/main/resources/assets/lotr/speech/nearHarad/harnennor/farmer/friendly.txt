The Sun has been hot today.
Good day, #. What would you like?
Fruits and crops grow well in these lands.
We farmers must work hard, for the soldiers need ever more supplies.
The Sun is hot here, but the crops do so well in it.
Remember to keep drinking!
I didn't see you there, #. Are you hungry?
I suppose I have a few potatoes to spare for you.
The farmhands are always thirsty.
Do you like fine fruits, #?
The warlords are always demanding more crops for their taxes.
You wouldn't want to work the fields on a hot day like this.
One should not work beneath the Sun for too long.
The yellow Sun is a burning eye, but Lord Sauron's eye burns brighter still.
Our friends in the South keep slaves on their farms. But a harvest gathered by slaves is no good harvest.
I do not believe in the use of slaves. It is cruel, and the crops suffer.
