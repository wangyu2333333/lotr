Stop this fellow, before something is stolen!
Northerners! Someone, call the guards!
By the Great Serpent! Assault, assault!
You shall pay with blood, northerner!
My shop is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Let us barter and live in peace, warmonger!
Men like you make me sick, ruining a peaceful bazaar!
Have you no respect for unarmed citizens?
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade!
Leave now, and never come back!
Ninzâyan forever!
You cannot honestly think you can beat us Ninzâyanim?
All this effort, and you still resort to violence?
Oh, you want to trade blows? That's fine by me!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
