The Sun is hot today.
It is such a hot day.
Farming these fields is thirsty work.
I would delight in a cup of arak.
Must we work forever, #?
It is hard to work in this heat, #.
One should not have to work beneath the Sun for so long.
The crops grow well in this heat, but I do not work well in it.
The yellow Sun is a noontide dread...
Worry not, #. We shall have these fields harvested before long.
Always there is more to sow, more to harvest...
