Another day, another army. Will it ever be different?
You're a northerner? I'm surprised you made it this far without either side attacking you.
Have you seen the dark mountains, #?
I heard there has been trouble at Bêlkadar again. I pray we keep our hold on the Aphûrnin.
Have faith, #. Lord Sauron will make sure those northerners turn to ash, soon enough.
I heard rumours that riders from the East have come to Ninzâyan. What a time to be alive!
I don't suppose you will be helping our warriors push further north, #?
Lord Sauron has promised us the coming of great warriors out of the South, who will crush the Gondorians with a single blow!
Have you seen the skulls of Ninzadîn, #? It's the promise we made to all Gondorians.
I heard the Men of Umbar still haven't left their waters. Will they ever commit to this war like us?
I hear the lands of Umbar are evergreen and filled with trees bearing many fruits. Why don't they ship some more up our way?
I used to work on a farm, #. Unfortunately, it was raided by the Gondorians when they reached the Aphûrnin.
There are few comforts in time of war, but I for one cannot wait to lay my eyes on the White City burning.
Keep your weapons where I can see them and we should be fine, #.
Those rangers are getting on my nerves. Why don't they come and face me in a fair fight?
Gondor can't hold on forever. We will break through soon enough!
Hot day today, isn't it?
