Get out of @!
Get out of my tavern, you Northern beast!
We do not serve beasts like you in here! Out! Out!
Begone at once, #!
No arak for you, I think!
Not for all the silver in the world would I feed an enemy of Ninz√¢yan.
Guards! Guards!
You are not welcome here.
You are a beast, #. A beast, and a dumb one, to come in here!
Get yourself out of @!
The guards will escort you out, soon enough.
