Another day, another army. Will it ever be different?
Have you seen the skulls of Ninzad√Æn, #? It's the promise we made to all Gondorians.
There are few comforts in time of war, but I for one cannot wait to lay my eyes on the White City burning.
Keep your weapons where I can see them and we should be fine, #.
I don't normally talk to the likes of you, but something tells me you're all right.
Gondor can't hold on forever. We will break through soon enough!
Go, lead our men into battle, #!
