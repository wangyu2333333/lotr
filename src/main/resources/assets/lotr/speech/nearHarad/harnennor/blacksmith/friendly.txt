Greetings. Have you come to trade with us?
The nomads of the Great Desert promised to bring me back something special from across the sands.
Believe it or not, trade has been good for me, #.
Keep your weapons where I can see them and we should be fine, #.
I don't normally talk to the likes of you, but something tells me you're all right.
Hot day today, isn't it?
I am sure I have something in my wares that'll catch your interest, #!
I've got a special price for you, friend!
Look on my works, northerner, and barter with me.
A good man never says no to another trade.
You seem like a traveller. Come and let me show you something worth staying for!
