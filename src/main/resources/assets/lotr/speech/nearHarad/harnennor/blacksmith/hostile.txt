Northerners! Someone, call the guards!
Come here! I'll show you the strength of Harad!
You won't survive for long this side of the Aph√ªrnin!
By the Serpent! Assault, assault!
I don't know how you made it past our warriors, but your path ends here!
You shall pay with blood, northern fiend!
Are the green lands not enough for you? Begone!
