I do not work tirelessly on the farm just to feed our enemies!
I will not trade with an enemy of our people.
Who are you, #? Some beast from the North? Begone!
Get away from my land!
I pray that you wither beneath the Sun.
We have no business together, #.
You should not have come to our lands.
Get away, or I shall strike you with this!
Do not come near my farm again, #!
Guards! Keep this villain off my farm!
I should have the farmhands strike you, #!
