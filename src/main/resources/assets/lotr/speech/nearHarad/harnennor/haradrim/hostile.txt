Northerners! Someone, call the guards!
You shall not burn any more of our lands!
You won't survive for long this side of the Aph√ªrnin!
By the Serpent! Assault, assault!
I don't know how you made it past our warriors, but your path ends here!
You shall pay with blood, northern fiend!
Are the green lands not enough for you? Begone!
We have fought northerners for generations. Your assault means nothing!
