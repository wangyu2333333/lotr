Begone! You aren't welcome here!
Back away from the wares!
How dare you show your face like this!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
I have half a mind to drag you into the burning sands with us!
Curse you and begone, #, you are no friend of Harad!
And here I was thinking perhaps there was still some hope for the pale-skinned!
I knew you weren't trustworthy!
You will not leave my sight alive, #!
The price for your crime is your life!
Such lack of decency! You are no better than the bandits!
I hope the Sun burns you alive!
I hope your bedroll will be full of scorpions!
Even if you survive, the desert always claims her price!
May the vultures feast on your corpse!
The Great Serpent shall not forgive you, #!
We are trained to kill thieves. You'll be no trouble at all!
Just you wait, northerner. We are coming with more than you can prepare for!
You think you can beat us? We were raised by the desert herself!
Our endurance will long outlast yours, rat!
I will chase you across the desert if I have to!
I don't need water to drown you. I will use your blood!
Now, how did those incompetent soldiers let you pass the borders of Harad?
Let me introduce you to the nomadic way of torture!
You can't honestly think you can beat us desert-conquerors!
