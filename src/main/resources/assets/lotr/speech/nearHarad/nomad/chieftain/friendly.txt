I'm sure our endurance would outlast any other army if we did have to take up arms against the North.
I suppose you look like you're ready to lead my men.
If you wish to hire my guards, you will need to pay me well!
Keep one eye on the guards, #. Especially if you have any valuable goods lying nearby...
My guards are well-trained, #. But they do like treasure.
You want to hire my guards? Do you have the coin?
Our guards are trained to escort the trade caravans. But they are no less fierce on the field of battle!
Welcome, #. Are those silver coins I hear clinking in your pockets?
I hope you have the wealth to back yourself up in here.
You may be a friend of our people... but here, we care more for the amount of silver you carry.
By the Serpent! How did you find our camp, #?
