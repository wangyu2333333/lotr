Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
How dare you show your face like this!
I have half a mind to drag you into the burning sands with us!
Get away from my pockets!
I fear you will try to rob me! Begone, #!
And here I was thinking perhaps there was still some hope for the pale-skinned!
I knew you weren't trustworthy!
Such lack of decency! You are no better than the bandits!
I hope the Sun burns you alive!
I hope your bedroll will be full of scorpions!
Even if you survive, the desert always claims her price!
May the vultures feast on your corpse!
The Great Serpent shall not forgive you, #!
Even out here, the pathetic Men of the North seek to torment good people!
You think you can beat us? We were raised by the desert herself!
This is why we hire the guards! Help!
You're hired by those men from Bakrîzad, aren't you?
You must be after what I bought at Izêm-ulzuz. On your own head be it!
Unfortunately for you, I haven't sold all my weapons at Ijdi-ilel yet!
Now, how did those incompetent soldiers let you pass the borders of Harad?
Let me introduce you to the nomadic way of torture!
The smiling game is over, #. You don't deserve it.
You can't honestly think you can beat us desert-conquerors!
