You don't seem like you're from around here.
Some find our lifestyle strange, but I see only strength in taming the heat of the desert.
Bandits are the least of my worries in the desert.
Keep your hands where I can see them and there won't be any need for trouble.
Bandits - those honourless thieves, they disgust me!
I prefer to follow the Arênin when we travel towards the Gulf.
If you are like me, you meet a lot of different people who all act the same.
Your skin doesn't seem too familiar with the heat of the desert yet.
I'm sure our endurance would outlast any other army if we did have to take up arms against the North.
The women of Bakrîzad always make someone like me feel welcome.
Some of my friends stick around Ayûkaph-amâm. Something about an easy life. Ha, how boring!
If you should ever pass through Ajtiaz an-Ahâr, stay cautious. A lot can go unnoticed there...
I hate to admit it, but war is good for business.
Ijdi-ilel might be far, but weapons don't sell better anywhere else.
I personally believe Izêm-ulzuz has the most fascinating of bazaars.
I want to travel by the Arênin once more, before I retire.
Rumour has it that the dawn burns the sands of the east until they turn red.
If I see you sneaking around the wares, you are in trouble.
Keep your weapons sheathed and we will be good.
No touching the wares unless you are invited to.
