For Harad!
Stay away, Northlings!
No Northling filth will harm our trade!
What are we guarding, exactly, #?
As you command, #.
As you command, my chief.
Northerners be accursed!
The Sun shall scorch the Northlings!
The serpent strangles the tree...
I guard our caravan with my life, #.
Oh, I should love to be paid better.
Death to the enemies of the trade!
Northerners are worse even than scorpions!
I shall stand guard, if I must.
We'll keep your enemies away.
Northlings begone!
The trade must continue.
I'll keep the thieves out, #.
Nobody gets past us.
That's it for the Aph청r-l창i.
Aph청r-l창i stink like scorpions!
I never break my guard, #.
