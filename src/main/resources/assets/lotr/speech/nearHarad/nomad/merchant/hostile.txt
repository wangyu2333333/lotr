Curse you and begone, #, you are no friend of Harad!
I have half a mind to drag you into the burning sands with us!
Even I do not trade with filth like you!
I will not accept the tainted coins of Gondor and its allies!
Get away from my pockets!
I fear you will try to rob me! Begone, #!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
This is why we hire the guards! Help!
You're hired by those men from Bakrîzad, aren't you?
What, were the Corsairs not happy with their trade?
You must be after what I bought at Izêm-ulzuz. On your own head be it!
Unfortunately for you, I haven't sold all my weapons at Ijdi-ilel yet!
