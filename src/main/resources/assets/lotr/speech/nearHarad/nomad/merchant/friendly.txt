I have travelled far across the sands, and all to bring you a good deal!
We merchants travel far and wide across all the lands of Harad.
Only we know the secret paths among the sands.
I hear your coins a-clinking, #.
Treasures! Treasures from beyond the desert!
For you, #, I give a good price!
I have a deal you cannot turn down, #!
By Mulkhêr, I hunger for kebab... perhaps you have some to sell, #?
All this travelling makes one thirsty!
Have you any food to sell, #? We shall have need of food on our long roads across the sands.
I bring grand treasures from the far realms of Harad.
I bring goods and news from across the desert, #.
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
Don't let the heat of day fool you, #. The desert nights are just as perilous.
You don't seem like you're from around here.
I am always open to another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
Bandits - those honourless thieves, they disgust me!
Ayûkaph-amâm is where I was born, and where I became the trader you see today.
I am one of the few who know the way across the desert to Ijdi-ilel.
I respect the competitive nature of those Gulfings.
I haven't met any of those Corsairs yet, but trade upon water sounds... fascinating.
I do love meeting new people.
The women of Bakrîzad always make someone like me feel welcome.
Someone at Izêm-ulzuz once tried to trade me a child for my wares... I refused, of course!
The Morwaith don't like haggling. Their trade is as uncultured as their prey.
I hate to admit it, but war is good for business.
Ijdi-ilel might be far, but weapons don't sell better anywhere else.
I want to travel by the Arênin once more, before I retire.
I'm staying clear from Bakrîzad until those so-called Mûmakil are gone.
