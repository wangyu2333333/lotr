You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
I am always open to another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition drives better bargains, #.
I bring you the best wares from all the regions across the desert.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Greetings. Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something that'll interest you, #!
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
You expect me to afford the costs of desert travel with that price?
