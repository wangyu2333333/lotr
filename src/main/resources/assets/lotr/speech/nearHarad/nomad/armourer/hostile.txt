Stop this fellow, before something is stolen!
My shop is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Men like you make me sick, ruining a peaceful bazaar!
You have no place in our lands!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
Even I would not trade with a beast like you!
I do not sell my weapons to Northerner scum!
No robes for you!
May the desert heat consume you!
No, #! You will not convince me to sell you anything!
Flee back into the burning sands, you savage!
