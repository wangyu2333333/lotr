I did not travel across the desert just to get insulted by the likes of you!
All this effort, and you still resort to violence?
Oh, you want to trade blows? That's fine by me!
Desert sun and scorpion sting, your strike means nothing!
What a foolish act! The heat must have got to you!
Stop this fellow, before something is stolen!
My shop is closed. I shall do no business with you!
Men like you make me sick, ruining a peaceful bazaar!
Have you no respect for unarmed travellers?
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade!
You have no place in our lands!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
