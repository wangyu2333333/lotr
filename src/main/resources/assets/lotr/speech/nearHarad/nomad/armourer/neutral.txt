I do not trust you, #. For all I know you may turn my own daggers against me.
You have the manner of a scorpion.
Are you one of us Southrons? No, you are not, I think.
Sorry, #. I trade only with those who I may trust.
You will have to forge your own weapons, stranger.
You are a stranger to these sands.
How can I know you would not use these swords against me?
What do you know of curved swords?
No, #. I do not think I can accept your coins.
