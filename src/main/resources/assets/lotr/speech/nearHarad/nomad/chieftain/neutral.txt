You're not a trader, nor from the desert. Why would my men follow you?
My men serve their own people, not strangers.
I don't see your caravan anywhere, #. What use would you have for my guards?
Your sunburns tell me you aren't ready to lead my men.
The art of trade seems foreign to you still, #.
Would you even be able to afford paying my men to protect your wares?
