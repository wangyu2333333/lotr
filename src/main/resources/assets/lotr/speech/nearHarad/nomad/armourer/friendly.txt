Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
I am always open to another trade. What are you looking for?
I saw you look, yes, my weapons are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my armour, #.
Greetings. Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something that'll interest you, #!
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
You expect me to afford the costs of desert travel with that price?
A wanderer like you needs a fine strong blade.
You need some good clothing to keep the Sun's heat off. I have just the thing.
Ah, #! I have woven some fine robes just for you.
You deserve better than a rusty old blade.
Ah! #! You need something to fight the scorpions off. Come, look what I have for you!
