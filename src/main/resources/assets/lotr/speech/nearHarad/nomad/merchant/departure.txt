Hurry, #! I shall be away upon my camel before long!
Other lands, other treasures, other deals await me!
We shall soon be journeying onward. Now is your last chance!
We do not wait around forever, my friends.
Onwards! Onwards we must go! 
Come quickly, #, for the desert roads are calling me!
The road to the East is long, and we can tarry no longer!
Last chance! If we do not strike a deal now, you may regret it forever!
