Have you seen the Gardens of Barûphel, #? They say the flowers there flourish forever.
I used to join the trading ships from Ajtiaz an-Ahâr to visit the Eye of Harad.
Greetings, #! Come, see the beauty of the wares I brought along!
What is it that you wish to buy? For I sell treasures from all over the world!
We traders of Harad are well travelled, and for all that, we have many goods to sell you.
I am prepared to barter silver with you, #. What is it that you need?
Welcome to the bazaar, #! What can I do for you today?
Fantastic treasures from the ends of the earth, for just a few silver coins!
Welcome, #! Welcome! I offer you many fine goods from these lands!
For a few silver coins, I can sell you some fantastic treasures!
Welcome to my stall! What can I get you?
I offer you many treasures from many lands!
Thanks to the Sand-Usurers, I do not have to go south for my wares.
The sands have never done me wrong, yet I still long to see the green lands of the North.
Ajtiaz an-Ahâr will soon be a worthy competitor to the Eye of Harad, #.
The Athrassir keeps our lands green, and the trade golden.
Why would we bother travelling to Izêm-ulzuz, if the nomads and Morwaith already come to us?
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one. I respect that.
Could I perhaps interest you in some of my wares?
I am always open for another trade. What are you looking for?
Competition is a drive for better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
Greetings! Have you come to trade with me?
I am sure I have something that'll interest you, #!
A good trader never says no to another trade.
I think that's a price we can agree on.
I've already given you my lowest price, #!
You drive a hard bargain...
Meet me halfway here, I also have to make a living.
