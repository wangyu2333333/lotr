The scum of Gondor are no match for my blade.
The serpent strangles the tree.
Gondor shall fall!
I am ever in your service, lord #.
I would follow you to the ends of the earth, #!
To battle! To the fall of Gondor!
War is coming.
The lands of the North will soon be ours!
For Harad!
There will be no dawn for the DÃºnedain.
I am ready, #. Shall we go to war?
I have never lost a battle!
What is it that you command, #?
I am at your service, commander.
Tell me what to do, and I will see it done.
I am proficient in all forms of combat, #.
No matter the weapon I use, I will see to it that the blood of your enemies flows.
Where are we off to next?
We Haradrim are excellent fighters.
Give me the word, and I shall burn your enemies' lands.
I'm not familiar with that formation.
Form a line? What good will that do?
I am bestowed with the strength of a thousand men, so no army can outnumber us.
We will see this war to an end, #.
Ah, commander. Good to see that wound healing up.
It's an honour to fight for you, #.
I could march for days if you wanted me to.
I'll keep my guard up, don't you worry.
