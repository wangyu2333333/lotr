Welcome, my friend! What would you like today?
I forge the finest arms all across the desert!
Have you tried the bronze corslets, #?
Men come from leagues around to buy my wares!
Good day to you, #! I have many items in stock that may interest you!
I happened to be forging all morning in case someone showed up, let me show you!
My scimitars are sharp, my daggers keen, and my corslets polished!
You need a helmet to keep the sun off your head, my friend.
I presume you are here to trade with me, #?
Ajtiaz an-Ah√¢r will soon be a worthy competitor to The Eye of Harad, #.
I recently began dabbling in the crafting techniques of Umbar.
Bronze is a fine metal to work with, #.
Blazing sun? You should see my forge!
You seem like the type who would know a good deal when you see one, I respect that.
I am always open for another trade, what are you looking for?
Competition is a drive for better bargains, #.
I saw you look, yes, my wares are THAT good!
You have an eye for detail, am I right? Take a closer look at the quality of my wares, #.
