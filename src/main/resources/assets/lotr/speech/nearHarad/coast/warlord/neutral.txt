I cannot allow a stranger to hire my warriors, #.
Who are you? Are you a friend of Harad, or a spy of Gondor?
Until you have proven your allegiance with us, we will not fight for you, #.
Do you fight with us, or against us?
Who is your master, #?
You must perform great deeds in the name of the Haradrim if you wish to command our warriors.
You will need to do more good for our people if you wish to command my mighty warriors, #.
We Haradrim do not simply follow any stranger into battle. You will have to prove your worth!
Whom do you serve, #? The Great Lord of Mordor, or the foul Adûnâim?
You will have to prove your allegiance to my people, #.
I hope you are no friend of Gondor, #. Well, if you were, you would be mere sun-scorched bones by now...
Are you an escaped slave, or just a lost traveller?
