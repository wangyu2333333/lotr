You have travelled all this way, but it is for naught. I will not trade with an enemy of Harad!
If the Men of Gondor are your allies, you are my enemy, #!
You made a bad choice in traversing the desert to the lands of Harad.
I shall not trade my wares or silver with you. Sell your wretched goods elsewhere!
The silver of Harad will not ever find its way into your hands, #!
There is nothing for the likes of you to buy!
I will sell nothing to the scum of Gondor!
You will get no goods from me, #!
Off with you, Gondorian scum!
Begone from these lands, #! Your kind is not welcome here!
Off with you, #!
No business for you!
Begone, villain from the North!
You are an enemy of Harad, #!
Be off before I strike you with my burning hammer!
The only scimitar fit for you would be one embedded in your belly!
I would not trade with you even if all my coffers lay empty!
No trade for you, #!
Get yourself out of our lands!
You have the stink of Gondor about you!
I don't know how you passed our warriors, but your path ends here!
You shall pay with blood, northerner!
Are the green lands not enough for you? Begone!
