The desert heat must have addled your brain, #. We do not suffer your kind here!
Curse you, filth-friend of Gondor!
Return to the foul lands whence you came!
No treachery of the Aphûr-lâi may enter our lands!
May the fires of the desert claim you, #!
You chose most unwisely in journeying here.
Flee, enemy of Lord Sauron!
Your life and your lands shall soon be ours!
This is no place for a villain of the North.
Fool! What madness drove you into these lands?
These lands are not for you. Return to your precious North!
Scum! I will feed your bones to the great scorpions!
Flee our lands or face our wrath, #!
May the fury of the Sun consume you!
Begone, filthy servant of Gondor!
My people don't tolerate Adûnâim scum!
I shall kill you in the name of the Haradrim!
You Gondorian scum are all the same. When will you learn?
Your blood must spill!
How did you get past Gâth-azrazâin, then?
