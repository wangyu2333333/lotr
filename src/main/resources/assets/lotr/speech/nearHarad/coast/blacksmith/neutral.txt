I will not forge arms for a stranger, #.
I trade only with the folk of Haradwaith.
You shall have to go elsewhere for your weapons.
What are you even doing here, my friend?
You are not one of our people, my friend.
I have polished corselets aplenty, but only for the friends of Harad.
You are a stranger to our lands, #.
I would welcome you, #, but my heart grows uneasy around a traveller from the North.
What insurance do I have that you won't use my items against me?
Be on your way, I have nothing I am willing to part to you.
My apologies, but I can't trust you quite yet, wouldn't want you to use my wares to do harm to my friends here.
I care for competition, but I'm not that desperate yet.
