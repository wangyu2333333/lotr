You are ruining the atmosphere!
Your presence is chasing away my guests!
You are no guest of mine. Begone!
You will not get anything from my tap, barbarian!
Are you a Corsair? They always cause trouble!
Can someone fetch the guards for me?
How rude are you, to walk in here as a criminal to our people?
Drunkards and patrons, what do you think you are doing?
By the arak! So hostile!
I have no more words for you, #!
Your downfall - another tale to add to the legend of @!
You better start running before the mob gets here!
I'll crack a goblet over your head!
Run! Go ahead!
Can't you just leave us be?
I thought we made it clear that Northlings aren't welcome!
Let me remind you why the Haradrim will crush Gondor!
You must be one of those Adûnâim the Umbarim keep shouting about!
You must be a lost slave. Let me send you back!
All right, that's enough! Out with you before you throw up on my bar!
How dare you come into @?
Get out of @, you wicked Northling!
