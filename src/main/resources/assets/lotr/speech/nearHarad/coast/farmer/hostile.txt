You're not even worth the work all those poor slaves put into producing these crops!
Oh, suddenly you feel like you are better than us, #?
Here I am, treating you with respect as a northerner, and what do I get?
What a foolish act. The heat must have got to you!
Stop this criminal, before something is stolen!
My farm is closed. I shall do not business with you!
Criminals like you make me sick, threatening a peaceful farmer!
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade! 
You have no place in Azra-zâin!
Return to your own people, and take your savage manners with you!
The trade is off, but you will pay!
The price for your crime is your life!
Stop! Thief! Murderer!
Begone! You aren't welcome here!
I bet you're just a common thief like the rest of them!
Aha, a new slave for my collection!
Your lack of faith has driven you mad!
Ah, #. This was a poor decision indeed!
Even if I did beat you into submission, you would not be of any worth to me!
They say Adûnâim live longer. Does that mean I get more profit out of enslaving you?
When I am done with you, you shall envy the skeletons.
The Great Serpent will never let you rest!
I'll ship you off to Umbar!
