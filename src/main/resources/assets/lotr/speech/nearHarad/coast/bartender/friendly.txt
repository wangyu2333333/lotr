Raise your drinks in honour of the Great Serpent!
You in need of a drink, #? Of course I can arrange that!
Here to warm up, or cool off?
You're not from around here, are you? Well, you are welcome in @ nonetheless!
Stay a while and listen to the tales travellers bring along!
Got any tales of your own, #? We love hearing them.
You look like you need something stiff!
Sorry, but the real good stuff I keep stored for special occasions.
Loosen those lips with the sweet sting of alcohol, #!
Another one? Are you sure? Har, just joking!
I shall crack open a new barrel, just for my new friend.
Oh, do you mean to sell? Interesting.
Keep your weapons in their sheaths, and we should be fine.
I wouldn't wear a helmet indoors, but to each their own, right?
Welcome to @!
Welcome to my tavern!
Welcome to @! Please, make yourself comfortable!
To the death of all Gondorians!
Here's to the end of the war!
Even Corsairs are welcome in @. As long as they pay...
We don't see your kind here often, #. Would you share your tale with me?
Even the sand-wanderers come to drink in @! Well, not in this season, of course.
