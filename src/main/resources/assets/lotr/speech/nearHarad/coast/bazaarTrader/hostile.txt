You have travelled all this way, but it is for naught. I will not trade with an enemy of Harad!
If the Men of Gondor are your allies, you are my enemy, #!
You made a bad choice in travelling here.
I shall not trade my wares or silver with you. Sell your wretched goods elsewhere!
The silver of Harad will not ever find its way into your hands, #!
There is nothing for the likes of you to buy!
I will sell nothing to the scum of Gondor!
You will get no goods from me, #!
Off with you, Aphûr-lâi scum!
Begone from these lands, #! Your kind is not welcome here!
Off with you, #!
No business for you!
Begone, villain from the North!
You are an enemy of Harad, #!
Stop this one, before something is stolen!
Northerners! Someone, call the guards!
By the Great Serpent! Assault, assault!
You shall pay with blood, northerner!
My shop is closed. I shall not do any business with you!
Let us barter and live in peace, warmonger!
Scum like you make me sick, ruining a peaceful bazaar!
Have you no respect for unarmed citizens?
Disturber of peace! Defiler of trade! 
Leave now, and never come back!
