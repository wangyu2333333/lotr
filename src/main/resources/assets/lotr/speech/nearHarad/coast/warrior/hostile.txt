The desert heat must have addled your brain, #. We do not suffer your kind here!
Curse you, filth-friend of Gondor!
Return to the foul lands whence you came!
No treachery of the Aphûr-lâi may enter our lands!
May the fires of the desert claim you, #!
You chose most unwisely in journeying here.
Flee, enemy of Haradwaith!
Your life and your lands shall soon be ours!
This is no place for a villain of the North.
Fool! What madness drove you into this country?
These lands are not for you, my enemy!
Flee, scum of Gondor!
I will not allow you to terrorise our lands!
Your death shall be swift, scum!
What drove you into this madness? Your end shall be quick.
I will not allow the scum of Gondor to invade our lands! Begone!
Run to the hills, pale-skin!
We shall see if you are this tough when I am done with you, #!
I don't need anyone else to crush you!
We have fought northerners for generations. Your assault means nothing!
You are too late. Our victory is guaranteed!
May Sauron guide my swing! I shall destroy you!
You shall pay with blood, northern fiend!
Die, Gondorian scum!
Come here! I'll show you the strength of Harad!
