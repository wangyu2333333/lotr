What do you seek? Counsel, trade, or war?
My warriors are yours to command, great lord #.
Here to hire more of my men, #?
I have a few fresh recruits who would do well under your command, #.
If you seek battle with the Gondorians, you would not find finer men than my own.
Word has spread of your deeds, #. My men would be honoured to fight alongside you.
Do you seek to command the mighty warriors of Harad?
Word of your deeds has spread quickly in our lands. It would be an honour for my men to serve you!
My men are strong and mighty warriors. Do you seek to hire some?
Don't be fooled, #. The northerners are quick to use you for their own wishes.
Our men have a few tricks up their sleeves, #.
I will grant you command of a few of my men, in return for your services.
With my men under your banner, the Aphûr-lâi will surely flee!
You have proven yourself to me, #. Go! Lead our men to battle!
Be sure to leave some for the rest of us.
