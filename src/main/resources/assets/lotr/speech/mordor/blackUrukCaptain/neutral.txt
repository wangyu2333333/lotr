You think I'd sell my top soldiers to scum like you? Ha!
Only the fiercest of Men can command my Uruk-hai, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any Uruks to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The Black Uruk-hai of Mordor would never follow a weakling like you, #!
You think Lugb√∫rz just hands out its best Orcs to any old maggot?
You will need to prove yourself to the Eye, if you wish to command his mighty Uruks.
I don't just let any old maggot hire my Uruks! Come back when you have some Man-blood on your hands!
Go kill some of those filthy Gondorians and then I might let you hire some of my fine Uruks.
We Black Uruks only follow true servants of the Eye.
Prove yourself to the Eye and I will let you command my soldiers!
