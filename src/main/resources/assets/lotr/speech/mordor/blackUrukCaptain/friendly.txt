What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some soldiers, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Uruks here! They don't come cheap!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The elite forces of Mordor are ready for hire, maggot!
Mordor has many fine stinking Orcs for you to command!
The best of Lugbúrz don't come cheap, #!
You want to hire the elites of Lugbúrz? Then bring me a load of stinking coins!
You want my boys, you can have them! For a dozen silver coins of course. Ha! Ha!
My boys are the finest Uruks in all of Mordor! They'll serve you well - for the right price...
Orcs aren't free, much less Uruk-hai! You'll need to give me some coins, or no deal!
Come and get your warrior Orcs here!
