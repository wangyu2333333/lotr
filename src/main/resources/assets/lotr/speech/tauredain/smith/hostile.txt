No more dealings with you, #!
Thieves! Mongrels! Slaves of the Enemy! You are all dead in my eyes.
Grassland savage! You will get nothing but death from me!
How foolish of you to come here, #!
The beasts of the jungles will tear you apart!
There is no hope for you now, #!
What makes you think you deserve to wield my blades, #?
The lion's roar is silent here!
Our warriors will crush you, savage!
I will not trade with a savage out of the plains!
Come and see the sharp end of my daggers!
You are unfit even to set eyes upon my forge!
Come closer, #... if you dare!
You are lucky that I do not put a blade in you myself!
