Our obsidian blades will pierce the flesh of any Lion-Man!
Welcome, #. What would you like?
Do you seek a fierce blade, #?
What can I get for you, #, warrior of the jungle?
I hope you have enough silver, #.
My goods aren't pricey, but they're not cheap either, #.
The forge is hot today.
I will pay you well for a shard of obsidian.
Do you need some strong armour, my friend?
Deep within the earth flow mighty rivers of fire. And in the mountains, this fire bursts out upon the land.
The earth cools the heat of my forge.
There are great lodes of obsidian high in the mountains.
I craft mighty weapons from obsidian, but I am always in need of more...
Do you like to fight with something more stealthy? Go and talk to the shamans.
They say that in the days of the old empire, we fought with weapons coated in gold. Who would waste gold on such things?
Welcome, #. Perhaps you have some obsidian to trade?
